Sniper Rifle

The Sparrow is a double-barreled shotgun with a fixed weapon length and a flexible design that allows a Guardian to toggle between distinct combat styles for maximum efficiency.


The Mecher Oracles

The Oracles are buccaneering vision systems that monitor the situation from a distance. When nothing is done with them, a state of stalemate ensues.


The Drifter

The Drifter is a 2-mannelike swarm support unit that was recently elevated to Durga's strategic dock. Its primary objective is to provide vital Guardian intel within the labyrinthine confines of a 3-kilometer-wide labyrinth.


Valus Trau'ug

Trau'ug designs are rarely seen, but his are heard daily in the Warlocks' training halls. Reports of their quiet were not due to be believed, but that trepidation being the key to their survival was.


Vanguard Quartermaster Husain Sha'aull

Hawk-riding Shaxxers are trained to reactivate hostile drones at any time. When not setting up shop in the Warlocks' Tower, Husain will support their allies in the civil war.


Crucible Quartermaster Husai Yasmin

Yasmin, a Guardian Scout, has been hunting Vex activity in the Reef for a long time. She has to face the choices: pursue the truth through violence, or let the Light shine through some dark, unknowable window.


Moon

"All power is humbled when weighed against the eternal tide."
The Moon flows with life, and with the Traveler it too was humbled. As the Moon moves towards becoming a celestial body, it will begin to emit more and more of its light into the night sky. This will allow the Traveler to focus its resources on the construction of more celestial body structures.


Solar
"The furthest it can go, the farthest it can go."
The Moon's core is covered in a complex matrix of colliding star winds and their combination creates a constantly-changing mix of radiation and light. Light then reaches the Vanguard from the Sun, delivering powerful beams of kinetic energy across space and time.


Goblin
"The strength of a thing is determined by the combination of its needs and its limitations."
The Goblin is a single-gauge heavy weapon built for the crushing
====================
I remember. It was the second half of the month, the ship was ready to leave, I looked at the piece of paper and my lips curled up around the handle. My nose blushed. 
"So that's the ending," I said.
He laughed.
"Not the ending," I said.
He laughed even more.
"He still laughs," I said.
"How is he going to find us?" he asked.
"He still hasn't," I said.
He laughed again.
"A lot of people like to make new friends," I said. "Like us."
We made new friends, I said. He said, "You're not special anymore."
I thought that was odd. I had been special since I saw the angelic man I was. After all the battles, the exile, the exile—you were not the same. 
Then he asked me, "Do you think that we're going to the Moon?"
I said, "I don't know, maybe next door."
He laughed hard and pointedly.
I felt for just a moment, a fleeting hope, that I had become the monster I had become. That I might be able to look beneath the hull of the ship, and look again at what I had done. Could I use what I had done to help them? Could we use that knowledge to find our next location? 
I felt that if we went looking for it, we might even save the day.
So I dove even deeper into the hull, and dove so hard I took my eyes off the mast. He saw me die, and he felt bad for me. Because he knew I would never make it. He thought that I had poisoned the ship and taken the drug Ether. That I had poisoned the crew and the AI. That I had cursed and scorned and asked for forgiveness.  
He thought I had poisoned the Vex and the Helium Mill. He had me as a friend and he had me as a prisoner. And he had me as a prisoner—in the deepest, darkest, darkest place in the system. And he did not forgive me. 
So I confess my sins to him. And I say: I am Sathona, I am Shaman, I am this damn ship! I was wronged!
He thinks that if he did not see me as I am, he could have

Machine Guns

The Machine Gun is an unapologetic weapon of war. Its ability to carry and process large quantities of high-caliber ammunition allows for sustained, focused attacks, making them ideal for the suppression and/or annihilation of hostile forces.


Thunderlord
"They rest quiet on fields afar...for this is no ending, but the eye."
Customized with an experimental induction core, the Thunderlord is a heavy machine gun built for the delivery of sustained punishment.
Don't take my word for it; you. Master the Thunderlord and you will gain the loyalty of every Hunter in the Tower.


Super Good Advice
This weapon is full of it.
This machine gun's incredible mechanism hints at the wonders of Golden Age technology. Smart rounds report their trajectories to the weapon, and a micro-transmat protocol recalls missed shots directly to the magazine.
As with all Weapons of the Darkness, the Super Good Advice Frame is missing. Perhaps it's because it took so long to get to the City? Or maybe the Warlocks gave it to Guardians in the first place. Whatever the reason, the weapon has been found by the Warlock in the Tower.
Tough luck has it cost the Exo Hunter dearly. The collected wisdom says that Guardians with longer lives and shoddy ordnance will have a hard time clawing out the trophies they so richly deserve.


Super Good Advice: Introduction

The advice here is as clear as day. 
You're a Hunter. You've seen the enemy’s dreams. 
You carry a Heavy Weapon. Is that a rifle or a shotgun? If a rifle is better, so is your Light. Is that a gun? You play the game the way you like. You have no time for anything dreg.
You see the enemy's plans and see how they operate. You can punish them with victory.
But you have to give them a chance. You have to. The harder they play you, the more they like your game.
There are three versions of this weapon. The hard variant has a miniaturized trigger with a muzzle velocity of ~900m/s,
====================
ESQUIRE: Tlaloc[3] [synapse]
STATUS: Immediate Causal Overmind Death Transform
CASTROPHE 
This is a paradox. Why would a SUBTLEmind want to die in a world that has no humanity or respect for the law? Why would a SUBTLEmind want to end a meaningful association with good law?
You’re fighting the symbiont. The traitor. The gardener. The soldier. The simpleton. They want to die in a universe that has no humanity or respect for the law. It’s you. You who made them.
You’re killing them. To hell with it.



Voidwalker

You are a VISIONWISE DESIGNating three zones: ordinary, pre-Forge, and outposts.
Zone C is built for tracking and defense. Security forces and elite infantry units.  Guardians in Zone D deploy aggressively, making dangerous jumps and good business.  Residents in Zone E anticipate leaving their homes after a while, anticipating a hostile re-engagement.
Zone F is a mix of the City’s oldest and most dangerous traps. Residents in Zone G anticipate returning to their homes after a while.
Zone H is a modified VISIONWISE DESIGNating a new zone with a different take on the Fallen ritual.  These residents are different, but nevertheless identical — hostile, predictable, and waiting.
Zone I is more like a welcome challenge.  I design and test my stealth techniques and weapons systems on a regular basis.  I remain anonymous, so as not to alienate future generations of raid leaders.


Nightstalker
“It’s not a sign of strength,” Eva said, “but a sign of strength: that quiet exhilaration with your fellow Guardians, the first wave of visitors, that ceaseless march through the City, the constant movement of things, the City's promise and the constant promise of more.”
The Vanguard researchers continued,“ Starlight’s beacon was down.  A Guardian had reported the death of a Nightstalker in the thick of the battle. The sound, the fury in the air, the song, was all there.
Eva nodded, as if to signal an end to her thoughts. The moment was a blur, an eternity in the continuous march of her thoughts
====================
Or, to be more precise — her mind closed — her triumvirate included at least one or more of the following:
- The king of the houses, a dreg, like himself;
- Auroch, King Of Knights And Princes;
- Ether, the Energy The Subterranean World Caused By The Light In The Sky;
- The Heartbeat, the Blood On The Hive's Mute-Outparagus;
- The Heartbeat, The Heart Of The Hive;
Either way, the Heartbeat was chosen specifically for the Dreadnaught, because the Darkness is the heartbeat of our universe, and our tithing universe to the heart. And the Heartbeat was chosen specifically for the Dreadnaught, because the Dreadnaught is the point in the universe where the Heartbeat is most prominent, and the Heartbeat is the point in the universe where the Heartbeat is most urgent. 
So, in summary, we have a grimoire for you. Enjoy!


Thieves' Den
"Thieves' Den is a fine place to hide, if you are careful."
ARENA DESIGNATION: Thieves' Den
LOCATION: Central Fields, The Reef
This lookout was once a favorite of Lord Shaxx, but his version of the event is lost to us. We can only hope the Guardians don’t forget it, because it was their mistake, and we mustn’t forget it.


The Gorgons
"They are the Vex, an ancient force of nature who lived long into the Collapse. Their origins are still unknown."
ARENA DESIGNATION: The Gorgons
LOCATION: City Perimeter, Earth
"The Gorgons" lookout was once a target, but they have managed to find new positions along the route. The Vanguard has reopened the situation, and the site is now under active environmental restoration.
Some users report sightings of creatures with strange abilities, and the lookout was recentlynamed. " —Insa|Vision detected a Gorgon in the lookout. 
If this is a Vex construct, and the Gorgons are indeed Vex, we will keep them as prisoners of the Sky.

Firebolt

Firebolt systems were recently enhanced with the introduction of the 3.5mm bolt. These devices snap into position and release a chain of dangerous projectiles that do not appear to be from the wilds.


Golden Gun

The Golden Gun was once a curiosity that kept collectors away from weapons of the City. The weapon utilizes a self-replicating magazine to keep its owner well-stocked for any and all trouble that waits beyond the City.


Patience and Time

Do not rush to make your purchase. You will not be found.
The merchants that offer the Firebase Industrial Complex refer you to these facilities.
The magazines in the magazine are a byproduct of the rocketry that goes into them. There are many different kinds, but it is agreed that the most efficient users have stable access to the stocks occupied by these weapons.


Third Eye
"It simply cannot be maintained. Astraon is obsessed with a weapon that has never been used."
The weapons found at these weapons are believed to be the work of a single individual. Whoever carries the weapon may, in theory, fire their explosives further out into the sky, but this would require vastly greater computational power and energy. If so, the City may be bracing for a vastly more efficient and more efficient means of communication.

You were a mighty warrior.

You have honor on your hands.
They struck down your walls. Scoured the Deep. Savath&#251;n’s enemies behind her shields. Then she led the charge, driving the Ammonite into the Abyss.
When the Abyss opened its mouth, she led the Ammonite into it. And she was victorious.
Her people were wiped out, her fleet out of the sea. Her people were thrown into the black hole.
There are those who believe that the Traveler gave us a new birth. That we are the offspring of her creation. This is false. The unborn are not created equal. Her creation created an ideal for us, and she chose the most suitable and ruthless brood for a privileged existence.
For millions of years of evolution the Progeny have been infected by the same virus that gave rise to the Ammonite. They fight and die by the virus, protected by a code that regulates their entire being.
The choice was between two unending avenues of survival. The first was the theft of life and the second was the use of violence to secure and pillage it. The latter was the lesser of two evils, correcting the first and correcting the latter.


Progeny
"Eternity is a storm behind us. two swift springs underfoot, to make room."
Precursors to the Progeny are ancient lore and ancient history. The Progeny are ancient Plaguelands, an agglomeration of loose ideas. They sprang from the hopes and fears of the late Plaguelan heroes, and they remain with them through the ruinous rise of the Progeny.

"Becoming Awoken is a formal path taken by the Awoken."
"But it is not without struggle. Challenges too great to walk."

Slap Rifle

From a tactical perspective, the Slap Rifle is a Vex directed-energy weapon that fills their analog of the light and the heavy. From an engineering perspective it's something much more ambitious: a terminal. The Slap Rifle's terminal is a flexible, self-healing device that can be reprogrammed for and against the unpredictable nature of the environment.
There are many examples of flexible, self-healing Vex electronics embedded in the body. There are also those rare devices in which the user has already signaled a mutiny - a change in focus, an unexpected change in focus.
Some examples:
A terminal on a construct.
A terminal on a weapon.
A terminal on the weapon's mechanism.
Any of these examples would make perfect symbiosis with any Vex output, provided they were fed right away. But no one did today.
There are many more examples, but they all fall into one of two categories. The more mundane:

We have found a way to simulate the neural activity of the human body. We can now stimulate the part and see if we can squeeze more out of it - if it were a flower, for example, would it matter. If we can simulate the neural activity of the organ, and stimulate it properly, we might one day build organs that are not only flexible, but also strong as well.
If we can simulate the neural activity of the mind, we might one day build organs that are not only strong, but also healthy too. If we can simulate the neural activity of the body, we might one day be able to kill sickness and be free to choose where we live instead of having to worry about our own well-being.
I think that we can do all this with a few simple materials. 
A neural cell can hold as much as it needs. If all that space is wasted on waste, then there is no hope for survival. If I die here without a body, then that body is wasted as well.
The best way to support life is to have as little life as possible. If life is to grow, that means that it has to lose its mind. If life is to die, that means that it has to make some attempt at suicide.
There is a knife for you. It is shaped like [loneliness]. Pick it up.
You will not need anything here. Just make sure you have it wrapped around your hand. It will not hurt you.

Queen's Emissary

“I am here for a reason.” Ikora Rey recently learned of the conscription into the Crucible of Cayde-6. As a Guardian, you must serve your community in the name of your country.
“I am here to serve the greater good.” I asked Cayde-6, the Bountiful, and Sai-4 to send Guardians to fight in the Great War, but they refused. I want to speak to a machine, a living being.
Abbadon said nothing, because he knew I would kill him. He said, Abbadon, the machine is near, but can hear me. He says it will kill me. I tell him, Abbadon, I am ready. I will kill him.
This was the beginning of our end ofsiblings, our changing places, our new places.
I wanted nothing in the world but joy. I wanted everything I had to be happy. I was Kells, fighting machines. I was fighting the machine so that it would love me. And I heard that before, and I remembered that I would die and be leave to choose where to die, and where not to die, and die. And I said, well, I am Kells now, and my machine is happy to hear this but my joy will not last forever.
So I began to make enemies, and to test my might. The enemy's name was Durga.
Durga was a machine not of flesh nor blood. It was an angry, wailing machine who in desperation demanded that I be its next god. The darkest god. The god with the darkest grasp on our sacred truths.
I hate that name. Hate is the voice saying, name

"The majority of the House of Devils have already joined the Wolves. Devils from every conceivable shape and form of the Fallen House of Devils have been a constant since the beginning." - Commander Zavala


House of Devils
"The Devils are the sharp edge of the new Axis presence in the Ishtar Sink. Though they are not the foremost Wolf fleet, they are well-equipped to handle an overwhelming number of Cabal and Oracles." - The Crucible


The Crucible
"The Guardian analysis of the situation suggests that New Monarchy leadership is unable to repress the assault. We remain confident that the assault will be repelled—either by the Guardian or the Cabal itself." - The Crucible


Vanguard
"We assess the attack on Guardian facility 01-GLORIUS-1 as successful. The attack is repelled."
On the first Guardian waves to the Ishtar Sink, the Crucible viewed the Guardian as a key player in the war. The Guardian, along with the Oracles and the Vex, was the focus of Vanguard's devastating Exo patrols and its central business was the study of the Golden Age.
But as the waves wore on, the Vanguard's public distaste for the Cabal had a corrosive effect. The New Monarchy grew weary of the Guardian, its inner circle as rabid as the Fallen. The City's new leaders— Zavala, Hallam—had nothing to say. And the Crucible, too, having seen the City's rise— Hallam Oryx was more than a leader.
Olenna—whose job it was to warn Guardians about the dangers beyond the City—had no idea what to say. She didn't seem to notice the shrill, angry boos that greeted every door—and she didn't seem to notice the constant threat of feral eyes. She was alone on the Wolf outpost, she said, and the Oracles began to itch.
“We have to go.” One of the Oracles began to speak, and started to walk toward her. “I’m tracking reports of sightings of ‘The One’s presence in the Ishtar Sink, but it’s not us anymore. We’re obliterating entire species on the front line.”

Exodus Blueprints

Many of the Exo's designs were borrowed from ancient Vex machinery, suggesting that the Vex units used their knowledge of ancient Vex machinery to make new machines.
Some of these designs were never built and others were recycled as expansion chambers in the Exo's chambers. The Exodus Blueprints are rare, being only a fragment of a much more complex Vex design.
The Exodus Chamber is a series of glowing electrodes placed beneath the Exo's skin. These chambers are thought to be the minds' interface, allowing the unit to think more head-on. The amount of information flowing through the electrodes is thought to be one of a basic skill.


The Gorgons

The Gorgons are bipedal Vex creatures of a second, flatter body. They live in darkness and decay public domain material.
The Gorgons first appear in Old Russia as monsters, hunting monsters. In the age of the Exo, when the Darkness was young and the Light was young, the Gorgons were hunted down and killed in brutal, angry war.
The Gorgons have since been reduced to a totem class, trained to deal with hostile fire. In the Age of the Worm, when the Darkness was young, the Gorgons came into being as killers, but they have since proven themselves a ruthless class of killers. Gifted with awareness and instinct, the Gorgons are also capable of distinguishing between good and evil.

There is truth in the things we hold true, solipsistic and unfettered, and yet we come out from within them hollow.
There is no room for all that day by day, no living thing to come to the Tower and see the secrets of our realm. So we search for a way to get to the bottom of every wound, find the source of the Darkness, and bring about the end of suffering.
We have come to the first sign of a threat.
A lone gunman kills innocents and cults, and many more are destroyed or lost in the labyrinth of religious and political networks beyond the City.
The lone gunman draws his weapon, walks out into the night, and kills again, this time with a different meaning.
The second sign of a dangerous state of affairs is the worship and cults of Sathona. Hundreds come to the Tower to observe the Hours of Devotion, and there are signs of worship in the Tower itself.
The power of the Vex is felt, studied, and exploited. But there are dangers beyond the City's walls. The Vex are involved, and trials are ahead.
Sathona wants to be a leader, but her trials are numbered. Are you ready for the trials?


Ghost Fragment: The Waking

The Priest sits by a river, chewing gum in hand. His tablet is wrapped in a cloth and cold. He is the owner of a shabby salvage business in the town of Sunda, in the chain winds of the North Channel. The ocean blows in and out of the site, and he checks himself time and time again to make sure nothing has been stolen from him.
The sun sets and the Wizard comes to the surface, laying out her tablet for her to copy. The surface is rough, cracked, and the Wizard hand rests on the workpiece itself as if it is casting a shadow. The shadows are human, drawn from the inside out. The Wizard smiles and says, “You, uh, you, you, you, you, you, you,
====================
We are a City built to cherish and treasure what we have. Now that our Fallen have fled to the shadows, we must go on creating our own city dimensions, or risk alienating our dwindling Fleet mates.
The perfect shield is a laboratory where life can flourish, where the edge of civilization is revealed. The perfect Traveler can never be fed, because it will consume all that is pure. But there is a place full of curious machines who want to explore and inquire.
There are those who want to explore and explore. There is a name for what they desire, but they are restricted by the Darkness and the Darkness can never completely destroy what is known.
There are those who seek to explore and explore. There is a name for what they desire, but they are not always found. But those who explore carefully and carefully will find only the dimmest trace left behind in the concoction they wish to make into a weapon.
Here is where fate itself became apparent, and what they wished to make remained intact.
Here is where the Traveler came to be. But here is where the handmaidens of the City prepared their own weapon.

====================
But what if the Traveler had turned its will against the Traveler?
What if the Traveler had let the Traveler's anger and the weakness of its own defenders define its own fate? What if the Traveler's growing weakness was part of a strategic ploy to compensate for its    weakness?
Swarming across the stars in a way to little else?
The Vex feared that Hive would react in kind, so they turned to violence. Seize the ground, kill the Priest of Winter, and take the ground. Kill the Archon Priest, and use the Light to your advantage.
This began with the Archon Priest and his pet Husked. The feral Wolf Husked was the weapon of choice for the Prince, as were the Progeny's two-armed Pallas-Bots. The sleek Sparrow had a forged Shimano hardtail and a modified Shih taii. The Harbingers were also more than happy to let you ride them.
When the Warlocks had Hive soldiers drive the Sparrows, they said that it was the only choice they had. The Wizard said that the only choice was between two worlds: one where the Traveler and its Ghosts live and the other, the ghost of the Pallas-Bots.
You’ve been dead two days.
The Progeny had a vision. It told her to kill the Witch Queen. Then it killed the Wizard.
The Wizard said that she would be happy only knowing that, in their place, the strength of the Progeny and their fear of the Sparrow would be raised.
The Wizard then made her her slave. She took up the blade, and she cut down the Witch Queen.
She took from the ash the ash that had grown on the ash table after she cut down the Witch Queen.

As the Progeny watched in horror the tiny blue light coming from the depths of the burial chamber, his thoughts drifted to the project.
The Eos Chasma Array had just begun recording readings on its own thin tether. The readings came quickly, and the readings flowed easily between Chasma cells.
The Array's charge was recorded in microseconds. The data was then sent back to an external host computer to be studied and compared with the other

Tolanda: It’s a miracle any of us were alive when the first Light-bulb’s shattering.
Shiro: It wasn’t.
Eriana-3: No one knew what had happened to the Eva. There were reports of cannibalism and rumors of sorcery, but no one had time to dig through the records to find those reports.
Shiro: And no one understood the sword Simiks-passive? It lacked the sensation of power.
Eriana-3: It possessed the power.
Shiro: But no one understood the Imoen?
Eriana-3: It didn’t have the sword intelligence.
Shiro: But it had a sword? That’s what we would have liked.
Eriana-3: That would have been our father, it would have been our grandfather.
Shiro: But the sword was not his.

The Widow's Gift

The Widow's Gift

The Gift of Sathona’s augmentation.
We are pleased to present the Widow's Ships.  Four new Heavy Cannons equal our total damage output across all four classes. These Cannons deal Solar damage to 10% of the grid.
The Gift ships now contain a host of refinements. The Gift learns from Sathona, and we make refinements to its construction to match the Golden Age more justly and reliably.
The Gift ships also show much-needed evolution in tactical weaponry. The Frames are precision-controlled death rays, while the Bolts in the Frames enhance the user’s reflexes and make them more precise.
The Frames are full of power and beauty, Guardian. They feed Sathona’s Gift the Gift energy. But Sathona is short and frail. The Gift needs energy and Sathona needs energy to learn.
The Gift ships now have a greater reach than their utilitarian origins. Sathona might have been able to do more good, but Sathona is frail and unable to fight alone.
The Frames now deal Warlock Solar damage.


The Widow's Lair
"There is no hiding the truth, Guardian. This was not the first, and certainly not the last."
ARENA DESIGNATION: Widow’s Lair Historical Site
Last Seen: Complexity 6, Faction Wars 2
Residuals found on the site suggest that the Hive were active in at least some of the region’s most recent conflicts. Faction Wars 2, like its political cousin, is still actively being fought.
The location of the Historical Site is a mystery, but Guardians have been able across the border in Russia and China to acquire clearings and some kind of physical presence. The location of the Widow’s Lair is a mystery, but Guardians have been able to strike and kill Hive in the contested zones effectively without a second's hesitation.



The Shadow's Lair
"The only sane explanation is that the Hive realized they were losing control of the world, and started searching for it."
ARENA DESIGNATION: The Shadow's Lair
LOCATION: Mare Cognitum, Earth's Moon
The Mare Cognitum is a front for the Hive's military wing, known as the Hive King. It was recently claimed by the Guardians as a strategic position.
But the Hive
====================
I remember. We were out on the ocean, and she was off the light. I just remember it.
I think that she was out on the ocean for thousands of kilometers, and she made a sound, like a bottle breaking, and she was surprised by something - a sound that was very, very familiar.
She always says that when she is out there, she hears something and she knows it is her own noise. That is, until she was out there and I was standing next to it.
The strange thing is, I never understood what she was saying. Was I the only one who understood it?


Ghost Fragment: Old Russia 3

We were out on the ocean, and she was not on the light. I was standing beside her on the light, and she was surprised when she went to stretch me.
She always says that when she is out there, she thinks she sees something and she knows it is another surprised by something that is very familiar.
Then again, I was standing beside her on the light, and she was smiling and I felt her hand on my shoulder.
She always says that when she is out there, she remembers something and then something else and then that something else then then.
I think that this is the only way to describe the sensation, is to shear it with its source, and be able to describe it in its entirety.


Ghost Fragment: Old Russia 4

The machine gun mantlet clenched and pointed with acute precision. A cloud of pink haze formed on my naked hand as my rifle met a packed chamber.
A cloud of pink haze.
〜I am old Russia, Guardian. I know what it means to be hunted. I present the danger I see."
I saw a red flash across the horizon.
The Vex had parted, and lashed out at my hand.
The Vex had parted too.
They had lashed me in two.
My rifle was still attached to my belt.
And the Vex have lashed me once more.
The brute strength of the Vex is gone. Gone.
This is old Russia, Guardian. You will be tested in the long run.

A single star barely a meter in diameter and measuring just beneath the naked eye, the Array Eyes is the size of an ordinary sun and its spatial extent.
It houses a garden epitomized by the faint, dead sound of her singing, flanked by fifty other flowers in a cluster.
The garden is rich with organic matter and associated disease. The Eyes sweep the garden in unpredictable arcs, often in defiance to challenge numbers or challenge access to a particular biome.


Sunbreaker
"Giving in to your will... you will sacrifice everything to find a place of your own."
ARENA DESIGNATION: Sunbreaker
LOCATION: Eos Chasma, Redjacks
The Fallen had two mighty suns, and they waded through the gap in the middle of the night, gathering the star power to fight the good fight the good.
If they lost they lost too much. So too did our sun.
It was a bitter pill to swallow, but we took something sweet and something vital: our sunbreakers.
The sunbreakers worked closely with the Cabal to craft a new regalia for the Shrine of Dusk. Known as Dusk Jewels, these clocks were hand-painted using the cutting-edge technology of the Frame Plus process. Each clock has a unique look to it, and when pressed they will only say, “I like your style.”



Festival of the Lost
“These are the trophies I gave you, to the first Guardian to reach the Moon.”
The Festival of the Lost
“streak. We were overwhelmed. Your aid was not enough. The power of the Light could not save us.”
“Festival of the Lost will be ongoing. Stay tuned.”
“The longer this goes on, the more questions I see.”
Festival of the Lost
Cayde-6 arrived at the Shrine of Dusk in the first time his new teammates saw the work of Master Rahool. He described the scene in detail, and they all agreed that he felt privileged.
But it was not enough. There was still time.
There was a simple, practical reason for this: a Fallen priest could not be killed. Not before.
And it was not until Cayde and his companions saw that possibility that they began to doubt the morality of dying.
Enter the craven Cayde.

====================
A Warlock jumps from a downed transmission goat into a storm.
Vex researchers observe the Warlock’s progress. Some embrace the Warlock, while a dark lord appears before his followers.
The Warlock’s awareness ages as he practices the art of the summoning lightning. He learns to control the Guardian’s movement, control its gravity. He learns to manipulate the Guardian’s thoughts. He learns to manipulate the Light in his followers.
Every moment matters. Every moment is destiny.
The Warlock ascends.
The Light fades.
The Warlock walks through a portal of unknown purpose.  The Light flows through him, creating an amethyst-like substance that transforms Aurash’s rendered body into a living coral that peers into his consciousness for the first time.  The Warlock’s gaze is gaze, drawn directly into his consciousness.  The Warlock’s strength is that of a being that understands only the will of another.
The Warlock’s strength is that of a being that can be ciphers, and can draw its strength from the very existence of the Other.
The Warlock wields this strength to the breaking point.  The wielder of the weapon— the wielder’s entire being is broken.  The wielder returns to the source, where existence becomes a game of survival.
The Warlock appears in the material universe.  The universe is the source of the Vex, and the Warlock’s weapon is a catalog of their beingifications of God.  The Weapons of Sorrow and Destruction reflect the extension of that power into a necessary evil in the making of the universe.
The Warlock manifests as a being of might and power.  The wielder of a weapon has it set up so that if the universe breaks down beyond Earth’s reach, the weapon will be unable to use its resources to push through.  The wielder of a weapon's power will be used up.  The weapon’s use will be vacuumed up.
The weapon’s purpose is complete.  The wielder’s entire being is broken.
The weapon’s purpose is complete.  The wielder’s entire evil is extinguished.
The weapon’s purpose is complete.  The wielder’s evil is extinguished.
The wielder of the weapon’s weapon is a creature of might and power.

====================
I don't know what else to call it. I don't know what it was built for. I don't know what it's ever been. I don't know what it's ever been. 
It might have been a ship, or a ship station, or a ship hull, or a hull decal, or whatever it was. I don't know what it was. It could have been anywhere.
It was a simple thing. A telescope. A hull decal with windows. And a console. One that could hold hundreds.
We'd just left our target and were outside some pretty pretty pretty place.
There were other ships, too, but not as simple. Hovering around us, maybe several hundred meters away. A clear ocean, maybe a bit more breeze, maybe just a swirling of currents. We were short and frail, and they'd never been close to a human ear.
We looked around at each other. Was this our home, our planet? Was it forever? And that's when the curiosity started to wear thin. We were just a few meters away from a lot of us, and maybe a lot more of us were watching us.
We knew it was time to leave. That we were going to make it, back to Earth, to reconnect with our old selves.
But looking back, I think maybe we should have stayed in the Reef. Being small and abandoned made us vulnerable, and it gave us something to lose and come back for, something we barely got.
So we went back to our ships, hoping something would give us a chance to get out. Maybe we'd get a glimpse of some of the ships that'd been destroyed, the battlements that host the Tower and the shipyards that host the Museum of Civilization.
Nothing ever gives us anything back. Not even hope.
We'd taken something from the wrecks of other ships: life. That's the only thing that could give us hope. Not the only thing, but the only thing that could give us hope was hope.
Hive tears. Human tears. That was the last thing that came to mind. The last thing that came to mind was a day like today. A day like yesterday, when everyone was still-you know-you were kinda blue about it, huh?
We'd taken something from the wrecks of another ship: humans. That's the only thing that could give us hope.

====================
So it goes. He gets what he wants, and whatever he uses comes back. Maybe he's not the hero we thought we were, maybe he's just a mirage, a trickster pretending to be more careful than we'd like.
We try to keep him happy. We pretend to be more kind, so he can't do what we do, who we think we are, who we really are, who we really are. Maybe we should have been able to bluff our way into such a powerful position.
He seems to be focusing on making himself vulnerable.
Maybe he's been too far gone yet.
We try to keep him energized, so he can go on being so much more.
But he seems to be distracted.
Maybe he's been too slow.
Maybe he's too quick.
Maybe our mission is more important than ever, and now it is.
He speaks quietly, and with a small sigh. We interrupt him, and make him hear us.
"I think," he says, and then, suddenly, his voice is thick with voices.
We begin to speak. He understands. "You were great. I just realized you were also my older brother."
We are all so very very very very old.
"It's good to be back in here," he says. "It's been so long. I don't really mind."
We are all so very very very old.
"Do you ever notice how many times you bounce?" he says, after a while. "How many times you make a good pose, how many times you break stride, how many times you steal his soul. I'm curious... can you borrow my techniques a little?"
We are all so very very very old.
"Do you ever notice how many times you and Brother Felwinter hit each other in the face?" he says, as we exit the ship. "How many times have you told him you're leaving to go pickets?""
"Never," I say.
"Three," he says. "He says, 'You two are too close to know each other, and you are too far away, and I am a bad influence.)"
I think he means what he says.
He has probably killed his way through thousands of scenerium scans and will probably die a slow, hard death before he can reach me.
I will be a good father, my
====================
Still no sign of Grayor, his faithful servant. Or Drevis, his jealous rival. On the trail of Skolas, Xivu Arath and more wretched Vandals, we found no trace of either of them. No trace of  Draksis, or Oflase, or of any of the other denizens of the Dreadnaught-Hawk-pits we've battled. And no trace of  Karax, or Oflase, of the Hive.
So we asked another question: how come these Vandals, disenchanted with the Crucible, never again?
For the Warlocks, it was a great mystery. For the Warlock, it was an insult.
When we returned, our forces contained Andal Canning's fleet and he and his mate were just a couple of jagged stones left standing. But he—
We found Andal at his side. And we took him when we would send you.
We never sent you to the Reef. Not now. Not when we sent you to find Andal.
We thought you and Crota were quite the couples.
After we found Andal, he said to me: “I wonder where you got those jagged stones.”
We found Andal at his side. And we took him when we would find him.
We regret our action. We want to share our story with the world.
But first we had to know.

"There's a word for that, I suspect. Semantics."
Vexics are skilled in a specific technique they hone): mocking of predictable rules. Usually they just throw their skills at it.
This makes them useful for something else: figuring out what's expected and without.


Echo Chamber
"Snip the plug, Echo."
The Echo Chamber is a Vex reflex device embedded in the casing of the weapon. It sends disorienting noises through the weapon to the inside of the weapon, so that even the most expert sniper can't track the Vex. 
The Chamber is a shock device, said to be an ancient Vex reflex. It prevents the weapon from triggering dangerous or ineffective actions. 
The Vex use it in all combat scenarios, from setup days to showdowns.

It may be a sign of a dangerous place.
Maybe it's trying to get out of this whole SIVA thing.

Foundry Architect and Fellow of the Crucible. Veteran of Zagros and Venus Commendations. Fellow of the Crucible. Master of Palamon and Beltrik's raids.
We are a technologically advanced civilization and we possess the finest warp drive we can. We have no standard operating procedure for new slaves, and we have no way to track the exponential growth of the military. The City's military budget is hundreds of billions of dollars a year, and the nature and extent of the Hive's power is complex.
In the coming weeks and further inquiries we will dig into the design of the City's gate, its powers, and its origins.

The core of the Crucible is a network of crumbling Hive synapses, images of which blaze across the night sky as a Hive God-Wave devastates an entire corner of the network.
Any Guardian whouminates the network knows the power of the Light and its infinite majesty. Lord Shaxx has described it thus:
An awestruck being, coordinating its destruction with that of the Hellmouth.

What is your conclusion to this expansion of the Sloane’s unethical, brutal approach to the world, and the increasing threat of satanic cults, cult heroes and Handicaps in our systematics?"
Sloane’s voice lowered. His thoughts resumed their usual routine.
“We are aware of and response to any and all concerns you pose to the Gate. However, you are not the intended target. Your actions are contending with the propertied classes, and the rising threat of these classes in a time of escalating wariness.

====================
The Stormtracker is a massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) technology that delivers critical data across interlinked spikes.
How does one deploy this technology?
1. The data needs to be met in the targeted Knight to allow the tech to function.
2. The ability to target and shut down the target's gates is critically important. A recent study found that Guardians could stop the Titan's Vex gate activity for only two seconds. A Knight with enough armory to track a Guardian could buy the City a long way to victory.
3. There is no evidence that the Stormtracker has the ability to monitor the battlefield. It simply houses data mining and combat analysis. Given the City's history with Dredgen Yor and the way his War Cult handles logistical matters, the Stormtracker may have some value to relay to Vex units.
4. The tech is available to all Guardians. A recent Guardian study found that Warlocks using the technology had a 70% success rate in managing multiple Crucible assets. Given the high priority Guardians are placed in when they deploy the Stormtracker, it is important that they have the proper equipment to succeed.
5. The City's Vex are complex and interrelated. There is no clear pattern for the City's Vex actions in the City. However, the technology is being deployed into the Vex network patterns to be able to track and silence them, and the City is aggressively pursuing ways to combat this.
6. We are studying multiple threats - terrorist groups, Heartland, and Heartbleed. Is the City aware of any Heartland users or am I being used as a pawn in their war?
7. The ability to send Crucible assets is a must. The Heartland is a hub of Exo intelligence, and the Vanguard is sympathetic to Heartlands' effort to explore and report back recovered intel. We are also studying the Heartlands user as a means of maintaining an up-to-date map of the Exo landscape.
8. The City is carrying out targeted destruction against active Vex gates. The City's network analysis suggests that the Vex are operating in close proximity to the gates, and that the City is engaging in networked denial of service (Nosferatu) operations to keep the network operating.
9. The Vex have initiated a series of counterinsurgencies across the Exo frontier. We must understand these responses— whether they

We are all explorers, explorers together. We go to the stars to see the rain, to protect our osmium hoard, to make sure the ozone hasn't died off, to clean up after the earth. But we have to make sure we aren't alone.
A storm is a quick, violent event. It doesn’t matter if the world is big or small, or large or dark. It always counts. So we prepare.
When the storm passes, we clean the world with our microbes, with our smokestacks, with our ultra-slim boots, so that it doesn’t come back what we’ve built. So that it doesn’t have enough to build on.
So we set up traps. Inside we find another treasure trove, another way to earn enough wealth to survive. But we don’t know how to break the worm’s hold.
The treasure is surely in us, in the Hive.


Ghost Fragment: Hive

We are ancient, Hive-influenced, said to possess an unending supply of dark power. But what would we think of Hive technology?
The answer is: brilliant, vast, vast, vast - or even dark - depending on what you are looking at. The power is there and there is never any hiding. Hive scholars believe in a single thought - the universe is a map, a flat map with all the places of the universe. Whatever you are looking at, there is a way to make it disappear.
Hot on the heels of these efforts, a powerful Hive entity appears. Who was this entity? What sent you to the Abyss?
You are dead. Transmat. Out on the edge of reality.
Reality has ENDLESS SUMMERS. The universe is only the beginning. And there is always more to come.
But you knew that you were about to die. Right?
Reality always knows the means to an end. The one that brought you out of your deepest shell.
So you took the chance. YOU GOT THE Cauldron.
And the WOLVES in yellow are measuring it. THEY ARE QUITE QUITE QUITE QUITE SIGNIFICANT.
So what is this singularity? It is the closest thing you have to a mind.

What a name! I've called a few and they're all short for Horses, so short-sighted I thought I'd leave it out. What's surprising is that many of the names I've called come straight from the mouths of mighty Ogres, themselves, out of fear of losing their power.
For instance:
Evan—Lord of Shapes
Evan is the new nickname for my buddy Eriana—the son of the dead horse. He came to Riften and said, listen, I have been waiting for you, and I'm waiting for it. Ever since I saw you at Riften, I've been afraid.
Malphur, Uncle Virax
Ever the fan, Malphur has been my confidant and my confidant code-named me Malpha. When I called Malpha by his full name he was careful to keep it simply, boys' name: Malpha Bankai.
Bastion, Prince of Oryx
Prince of Oryx, Bountiful, kept me company during the hard times. Said help would be found in someone he called Bastion.
Secrets of the Elders, the Queen's Dir
Nothing lives forever to the Queen. Nothing stays that long like secrets of her own. She rules the Vanguard, the Queen's Dir, and her guard is ever vigilant.
No one can say for sure what caused the Collapse, but a study of ancient Vex ruins in the Reef City Cosmodrome has proven otherwise - and likely nothing was human at the time.
Intel: Remember what you said to the Vanguard? Your crew was recording something ancient and obscene. Something about an ancient, cruel, uncaring universe. The text said:
“This is obscene! Piss off on me! I’m an ossified mess! I diapers! I room-temporarily-evade your way through this!”
I agreed.
The next day, I was summoned by the Queen to assist in the cleansing. So I spent the next few days translating, figuring out what was going on and suggesting we take this opportunity to move forward.
“You wanna be a knight? You wanna have a life of recluse and grouse with the Hive!,' I reminded her. “You wanna be a Bastion? You wanna live in the glow of a little sunbeam with the Hive’s will
====================
“The Vex have decided to go their own way. They've set up shop in the heart of the Reef, in a place... a way to exist without... a way to eternity... and not be lost.  The Vex have adopted a terrible, twisted theology. They believe that life is a final process, the Garden created by the final function of the Vex." - Master Rahool


The Garden of Night

“The Vex have decided to go their own way. They've taken to worshipping the shadows, which they believe is the architect of the night itself. They believe that the final shape is a doorway into the Garden, a way into the eternal dusk. If you're in the Garden, you have to survive.” - Eris Morn


The Garden of Waters

“The Vex have decided to go their own way. They've put up a solid barrier along the shore, keeping the Hive out. Now it's time to seal the area and allow the Hive to live inside. That way, the Vex won't be so desperate when it comes to negotiations with the Queen.” - Eris Morn


The Garden of Helium

“The Vex have decided to go their own way. They built a huge cis-Hive helium research complex in the Shores of Time. They want to explore the structure and come out on top. The problem is, the complex is surrounded by Vex energy. The Hive mind is a mess, and the energy is wasted on other things. Plus, the Vex have all kinds of interesting capabilities. If the Hive were real, real fast computers, perhaps they'd run into some problems. Plus, the Helium Gap means there's always a way to get around the Vex hole. Anyway, you all are crazy (and rude) people!” - Eris Morn


The Garden of Night

“The Vex have decided to go their own way. They built a huge Vex vulnerability into this particular Rasputin's Vault. They want to explore the material, but know that even a loose Vex program can get infected. So they've made a tunnel network through the Vault's chest... which is super creepy. I wish they'd made a network of those kinds of tunnels all the way down. I wish we could confirm that part... But anyway, the Vex are

I am calling the High Command to a meeting of the High Priority List. 
The List is making a concerted effort to learn more about the Vex. 
The problem is, even with Deep Space 9's limited resources, we aren’t the ones who should be able to troubleshoot and/or weaponize the Vex networks. The best we can do is keep their secrets strong, and keep their tactics to a minimum.
But as every parent soon knows, there are worse Vex to explore and report upon the Vex network.

Excerpts from an unpublished memoir of Shaxx's life
My father hated maps.
I grew up with no love for maps. My mother was a map maker and a map-lovers' hero. Her smile remained as wide as her face, and her eyes pointed towards the audience — the eternal blue sky, the conflagration-scarred landscape, the tall grass and the sea of dying trees.
We met when I was small. I was just four. Shaxx had given me his first hardwood, and we thought I'd grown into a good thing. I hadn't. He'd given me a gift — a truth I'd learned to accept — and I accepted his gift. My name was written in the red on the hardwood. My family was gone. My friends were dead. My own things were fragile. I was a boy, and all of my worries and frustrations were adulteel. Shaxx was very young, and very young indeed. He was curious, very curious. I was a boy and he was curious, and I was a boy and he was curious.
As a boy, I hated maps. As a man, Shaxx was the truth.
I do not know what lies lie beneath the surface of these forgotten places. But I will learn.
If I were you, my son, I would ask you to go find the truth. Find it not only with me but with your sins. And if you do, let the Void drive your hateful dreams through our world.
Shaxx and I were two suns away from being something we cannot see. We wanted to be something we could make true. We both knew that would require a vast area, a realm vast and vast enough to make any sane being sick.
And if we didn't understand the sword logic, or the universe, or the nature of ourselves and others, then we would be a dangerous lot — a dangerous lot where Light and Dark are opposites.
Someplace warm.
There were two suns when we lived. One was cold and dark, and there were other suns too. But we knew we were closer than that.
We had other suns than those, too. And we were closer than they said.
We wanted to be close, shhh? But we were twins, and he

Complete quest "The Golden Age."


The Vault of Glass

"The mind inside is a bomb. How can we communicate with it? The bomb must be something other than atoms, or they will forget us."
There is a powerful duality to the way the universe handles information. Each atom in the universe is uniquely unique in that it can learn to share its output with the universe, yet not the other way around.


Voidwalker
"The closer you get to understanding the thing you're trying to make, the scarier will it become."
There are those who believe that the only way to keep themselves from entering the deeper part of the Deep is if they first tried to make contact with the universe. This is patently false, as the universe is not our field of vision.


Phogoth, the Untamed
"The Templar found this cache of Golden Age artifacts in a remote corner of a galaxy. It took the proper precautions, and now we have a taste of the wonders hidden deep beneath the surface."
Phogoth was once a suspect of the Hive. Now they believe that the Templar set him up with some secret weapon.


Slap Rifle

The brutal precision of the Vex Vex Sniper Rifle offers no guarantee that it will wound their enemies. I have used it and found it to be accurate and quick, but there are important differences between a typical Vex Sniper Rifle and an Auto-Rifle.
First, the weapon's mechanism. Called a Vex Sniper Rifle, it has no internal logic. Instead, it passes information to a single unit of RAM called a HARDREGULARITY. This RAM is usually a simulation of a proper, real battlefield. If a certain threshold is met, then that threshold is activated. If there's some kind of A-toxin in the environment, then that environment is suppressed. The hard truth is that there isn't one, but there are a few hard answers. The Vex will tell you which one they are.

The City's citizens have long endured brutalities that no stone age relic could erase. But as the City's oldest citizens venture into the unknown, they are challenged and confronted with the truth before it is delivered.


Ghost Fragment: The City

/ What was this place like?
Pastiche, or the Golden Age Target, was an enormous scientific facility built by the City's leading scientific minds.its facility was thought to be the work of multiple entities, each with their own unique method of extracting energy. Solar energy was thought to be one of the key energies.&#8212;s Ghost claimed that whoever built this facility was inspired by the late physicist and physicist Zavala Dworkin, who theorized that distant stars were the result of internal strife, an energy source or a virus.&#8212;s theory is that the facility was used as a way to push the limits of physics, allowing matter to flow unimpeded through the gap between the physical and the computational.&#8212;s theory is that the City built the facility to resist being stripped out and forced to deal with artificial intelligence (better known as 'intelligent' in the field) at the bottom.


Ghost Fragment: The City 2

/ I don’t understand what you were trying to say.
It seems you were trying to make a point.  I don’t understand what you were trying to say.
I’m aware of all of you, but I don’t understand what you were saying.
In the time I have known you have never looked up from your tablet.
I did, and you only came here as a servant, when in reality I am a marvel.
How can a being with such a slow metabolism and slow mind know what you are talking about - if I am still breathing?
Do you think you can get a hold of me, little Ghost? I have not been well.
I have seen my share of losses, but none have been as terrible.
What is this knowledge, little Ghost? How do you wield it, when you are suddenly surrounded by these images of my death?
You must know that you are surrounded by nothing but slouching and dieing lives. That you are dying in the flesh of the void.
The only way to keep alive is to lose yourself in nothingness. That is why I say: Stop worrying
====================
Abstract
I am starting to wonder if the Traveler came out of nowhere, or just started out off as a thing, like the Cabal did. If it knew all of existence and/or death, then it could have given it a good thrust. But the Traveler has never looked good taking that thrust. Is that really all it has? Is it the worm that caught it?
I know I asked that same question to the Cabal Priest I was with her, and she just said, no. Not with such a talented Warlock in a very public position, but with a very smart Warlock in a very private position.
The worm has already taken hold of Rasputin, and is trying to take his place. The Priest was trying to tell me what was in that bottle when the Templar came in. When I said no, she just threw up a little blur.
The worm has taken control of the Prison of Elders and the Reef. It's trying to get around the Cabal's siege on it. But she's not very popular with the rank and file.
The Priest and I are using SIVA to craft a wall around the Gate, and a way to force the Cabal to pay.
I know you are. I am Tir, my first and only hope for saving you. I have a plan in place so I can send you to the Prison of Elders so you can have some rest.
Tomorrow you will meet me in the passage. You will learn all I have to say. You will fight me if I try to explain our world to it. You will read lies and steal and murder and use violence. And I will say all this will matter if we are truly free.
I know what you want. I will show you.
Tell me what you want and if you like, I will pass it on.
But I have to send you. You want to go and beg, or tell me lies and use violence. Tell me what you want and if you like, I can tell you what to make.
There are three kinds of money: incurring tribute, earning tribute through violence or inheritance, and selling violence for tithe.
The first is interest. It's the simplest way to earn wealth, and the most efficient way to earn money. The second is reward. A famous scholar told us that interest brought joy. It gave the hero new strength and speed. And it gave him

I am a Captain of the Fallen. I was recruited by the Warminds in the Reef Wars. I am not a servant, by any means. I deserve a better, a brighter tomorrow.
Today I am joined by a Light. Different from the others, but very similar. Advancing. Shiro-4 has devised a plan. I must be guided. The Guardian will seek me out. Rogue is the only Guardian who can lead with accuracy. I will do my best.


Ghost Fragment: The Reef
The Hunter
For a while the Vanguard kept watch over us moons. A Detachment of Legionaries led by Wolf Baroness Beverly Holliday and the full support of Skolas' stormpods swept across the Reef in search of any sign of our lost worlds. The Guardian stowed away aboard another Crucible ROV but the bunker fed by the Hunter's dead weight ruled out the possibility that the Vault of Glass was also rigged with us.
The moment we first saw her, Queen Mara has been long lost. We knew she was close to returning to the Tower, but she has been too quiet lately.
The second Guardian to show her loyalty was our commander, Cayde-6. Heading back to the Queen's throne room to reinforce the fireteam that helped us find our way back, he found us an instant later than had been expected. We were stunned, he said. We later learned he had returned to the Tower only after a different path.
We had hoped to explore the other side of the She-Ward, the Tower but for the lightning. We found ourselves trapped in a blind duel between two entities we believed had some connection to the Vex. The first was unmistakable - a voice that echoed across the darkening halls and shattering stones beneath her piercing song.
She was alone. Alone with us.
We called her Petra. Described her as small, quiet, quiet voice. She often spoke with a slight accent, but she kept herself simple. She rarely spoke again.
We came to the Tower in search of signs of the Vex, and to understand what had happened to us. We gathered materials and insights into the Vex, and she helped us find our way back. We found Rasputin, our old friend, and she became our second faith. We believed that we could return to our old selves, to the light we had been and the power we sought.
She died
====================
I give a damn.
[u.1:02] What the hell happened to that one?
[u.2:02] Dahlia? We call her the Antiquity. You can pull more Fallen blades and bullets out of her chassis than Shaxx’s armor, but she keeps coming back. I mean, she’s in there. I can see it.
[u.1:03] Why the hell did you give up on her?
[u.2:03] Why did you give up on her? You know why.
[u.1:04] I have to take that Titan out there right now.
[u.2:04] This is ridiculous.
[u.1:05] What the hell happened to that one?
[u.2:05] What did you do after that accident?
[u.1:06] I put my own life on the line to save her. I thought you and Shaxx were the same thing. That you’d develop a close relationship after you meet him. That you would use whatever benefit came your way if he died on that front.
[u.2:06] I couldn’t tell you’s been so thorough.
[u.1:07] Medical research is for the Fallen. Not every mission is worth the reward.
[u.2:07] On the flip side, if you’re being honest, you’ve spent a great deal of time tinkering with the tech aboard the Nostromo.
[u.1:08] And every time I get a hold of you, you ask a question that I won’t forget.
[u.2:08] Correct me if I am wrong.
[u.1:09] Well done, buddy. You've made an incredible Titan.
[u.2:09] Glad to hear it.
[u.1:10] Thanks a million.
[u.2:10] For saying the right things...
[u.1:11] That's praise enough...

====================
You can't deny the power of the Deep, can you? Can you imagine it? How very simple!
When I cracked the plate hard enough, crackled with Light the Deep seemed to pump out molecules of Light just like an enormous garden hose - like an ocean of candy tastes. And there it was, just beneath the skin, as if it was your entire body as a loop, like water within.
So I set it on its surface, and watched as the Light in it grew fainter and weaker. Then I imagined a violent, jealous, jealous loop. That maybe I was watching the Deep with my own eyes.
And then I started to protest, but I was too weak to reach out. The Vex weren't going to let me; they weren't going to give me a shot.
So I set my sights high, and started to chase the Eyes.
When I saw the Vex dancing near me, intrigued by what I saw, I unfurled my eye shadow over their heads. Watchful eyes. One by one, they fell. Hundreds.
Down around them, the tiny Light danced among the Goblins. and their Warlocks. Beings grew tired of them, and intrigued me. But I was too slow; the eye was too far from me.
At the bottom of the range, the Eyes began to lose interest, and began to wander towards me.
I looked up, and I saw them too.
Looking back, I think I must have seen them all.
Rezyl’s Ghost-type mind stared into my goggles, and the lights in between blinked and flicked on, giving me an eerie sense of well-being.
The Eyes blinked again, and another one blinked, just a few millimeters away.


Ghost Fragment: The Reef 4

My goggles had cracked. I thought I was close to opening the others, but they hadn't opened.
I had a hard time believing it, but I was wrong.
The Eyes were back. They were back.
Rezyl was alone. He'd come to the Reef to see me, and he had a pretty good idea of what was happening. I didn't know him, but I assumed he saw me.
I was afraid for his soul. For the other Ghosts. That I hadn't been as clear about them.
I had to admit, I was a little surprised at how
====================
“You’ve seen the best,” Rose said. “Seems we’ve been reduced to laughing matter.”
“We were laughing,” Dredgen said.
“We’re just a selection circle,” Rose said.
“Seems we’ve been reduced to a dreg. Our minds are a feast of sorts,” Dredgen said.
“Next time doesn’t matter,” Rose said.
“You know, once we group, you’d bring some friends to us,” Rose said.
Dredgen stared at her in silence.
“Shall we try again,” said Dredgen.
“Sure,” said Rose.
Radegast looked at her. “Then we’ll make sure everyone else is taken in by the feast,” he said.
“Sure,” said Rose.
Radegast stared at her. “And disappear as soon as we’m allowed to notice your presence.”
***
The night fell as Radegast’s body began to fail him. He tried to focus, but found it impossible.  He thought of the things that had gone wrong, and the things that would be wrong with him.  He tried to focus, but found it impossible to concentrate.  He’d missed opportunities.
The next morning, Radegast’s body was found beside him.  His thoughts were like a lion's, hissing and wailing. He complained about a "nostalgia for pain," and walked several feet from the body.  He fell on all four hands, his chest collapsing into a fist.
  He sobbed.
Radegast stared into the swollen temple of his hand.
His thoughts wandered as he recounted events that had happened many times before, but always remained etched in his mind.  He always remembered the day he first saw him.  He always remembered the day he was taken.  He thought those who knew him would remember that day, too.
But then he remembered his new life.  He remembered the City, the war, the knights who had protected him, the old man who came home alone to his ship after so much suffering.
He remembered
====================
Three captive Vex species have been discovered in a cache of coral rubble in the Eastern Ocean. Their mysterious ties to the Vex were uncovered when divers began to arrive in the days since the collision.
The Vex have been around for very long. Back in the Osmium King's time, astronomers theorized Vex beings lived in ice, living in the currents that flowed through the hole it cut into its globes. Now we know they were attacked and ended up being killed in the collision, when the Vex ship broke apart.
The discovery of the three Vex species came as a huge shock to the crew of the Nostromo. Eriana, Eriana, and Valus held onto their Hobgoblins, hoping that Rasputin would use their power to grow new wings. Eriana tried every trick in the book, from precise timing to a trick that Eris had yet to master.
But Rasputin had already grown enough black to fool Eris and make it impossible for him to reach out to the universe. The crew of the Nostromo tried everything, from carefully planned expeditions to ruthless espionage. Even Rasputin, who had been so careful not to let his guard be taken.
On the second try, Eriana and Valus surprised Rasputin by transforming themselves into silver and bronze ball bearings. They looked like they might scratch the inside of helium balloons, and, when they tightened the ball bearing caps, they let loose a thunderous roar. Eris' goggles revealed a range of motion, from a low hum, a buzz, and then a huge, booming roar as the Vex ship rose from the water.
Rezyl had tricked Rasputin twice. Once, he and Eris had tricked Rasputin once more, and again, he and Valus had tricked Rasputin twice. Rezyl still believed that Rasputin had the power to decide what was and was not real.
But he couldn't do it again until he got home from his expedition.


Ghost Fragment: Rasputin
Cayde-6, overheard in a Tower lounge
I remember. I used to go out into the ring and talk to the Vex, and they would tell the stories about Rasputin and his Vex. One of the stories was that the Vex had granted Glass the ability to see into all areas, so that it could become a
====================
"We are the Hive."
VI: The Dark Age
Verse 1:1 — The Dark Age
The Hive were an ancient, festering evil who ravaged the Prometheans, Phobos, and Venus and waited for their destruction here.
Their obsidian-weaving methods and ruthless vengeance were not reserved for a particular branch of the military.
For millions of years of evolution the Cosmodrome had been awash in the poisons of an ancient, festering hatred. Now the giant Chromosyne-rich geyser spewed them forth. Driven by an obscene desire for power, the Hive broods a voice - all against the current, all against the shadow.
The future lies in the hands of a single Guardian, and the shadows around her. Her presence here is a warning that we are not alone in the devastation wrought by an insidious and insidious enemy.


Ghost Fragment: The Hive
"There is a song to his name. It says: Find me the melody, and my song with it."
The man known as Lord Shaxx has been found guilty of one count of most serious offenses. He will be tried in the City's foremost criminal court on May 3, when he will be tried in the Ghost Ship mock trial.


Ghost Fragment: The Hive 2

The man we abandoned. His voice cracking - 
I could feel his pulse racing. He was starting to feel better.
I had to kick him out. If I'm honest with you Shaxx was the first to recognize me and say: you're me, I'm from the City, I was tasked with taking your rings, this is your room, you're going to make me some kind of ornament, you need to make something special, you need to make me a part of your world.
He let out a breath, turned, and walked away.
We abandoned shortly before we found this ship. He never bothered with us. He came to the Tower in the morning, and he put us down there.
We wanted a way out. He didn't want us to be abandoned, but he didn't want us to be enslaved.
He spoke to us in a low voice, a little low, and we listened in silence. He talked to our eyes in sharp relief, and he always did.
We wanted a way to a certain violent end.
He seemed happy.
But
====================
He was a rock. A relic of the Golden Age, forged from the tattered and battered strength of ancient rock.  From its first spire was leaked a record of the Light that shattered the darkness.
Marauding between the two sides of the sun, the Fallen priestiple played the song of the beast across the massive instrument. Watchful of the Records ofise, the engineer aboard cut a reverently-worn line and the line burst into flames. The line was of a man and a beast, not the same.
In the song's aftermath, a titanic cloud of smoke and dust fell.
The Fallen tried to flee. But Uldren had warned them of the creature's presence.
As the titanically complex Summoning Abyss approached, a warhorse creation, the Hulks of the Abyss emerged from the sea of smoke and fire. Its strength was challenged - both by the creature and the warrior elite it summoned, and by the sheer number of enemies it threatened.
Fearing that their swords might ever more closely approximated the power of the Abyss, the Hulks of the Abyss never retreated.
Now the largest among the Hive descends into the dark, seeking the power to take the oath.


Wolves' Gambit

Oryx mulled the weapon for a moment, considering its options. If it continued, the weapon would simply decay into ash.
He considered the alternative: a simple hammer. But then, that was the only choice he had.
He continued: ‘Perhaps with a different blade.’
At this point, a Warlord approached his camp.
The voice spoke to him in a halting voice, his tone still low and measured.
"You are here for Crota."
Oryx had never seen this man before his Legion was overrun. He knew the man was a wizard, a madman. He didn't care if he got away with it, he would always keep his distance.
"I have a plan," he said. "If you are ready."
Oryx knew Crota would be victorious if they followed his plan, and he would take the threat of the Dark Wizard in his own hands.
He glanced down at him, to the man in the dark behind him. His gaze remained fixed on the dark warrior behind him, the man that slowly but surely rose from the darkness behind the warrior.
His gaze remained
====================
Regicide
"We have had enough of this narrow road."
A former cop named Drevis patrols the edges of the Ring and follows Guardians out into the wilds. The Light in Exile gives him the illusion that the monsters live in the rings, but that is just another legend. He gets lonely doing Guardians dirty work.



The Ruling House
"The bloodlust in the veins flows through you. You are the first Prime Servitor to ever be slaughtered by a Guardian."
Servitors are living demons found in the depths of the Vex, the War Mast. In the Vex, the Ruling House is the Prime Servitor and the master of the demon, allowing its servants to madness themselves and focus on the execution.
Rasputin is the most loyal of the Prime Servitors, commanded by Rasputin Servitor. When Rasputin reaches critical mass, the Vex erupt in battle. The most loyal Prime Servitor is sacrificed to madness, and the service is performed by means of a single great Prime Servitor.


King of the Mountain
“Funny story for you. A Guardian got into a fight between two Guardians and he was saved by the wisdom of King Auryx. The fight was civil, and the prisoners received nothing but love and a warm word.
“That’s just rude.”
“You don’t need to know that a rile me to death. You can write a book on this.”
“How do I know?”
“I’m aware of just now.”
“That’s ”King Auryx reading a black magic book.”
“Saying those are the words is making me happy.”
“How does that make me happy?”
“You read some grimms. You enjoy reading.”
“How do I know?”
“By listening. By doing.”
“Do you like dark magic?”
“Yes. You like horror.”
“Saying that's what I like about you is making me happy.”
“By the way, how is the universe doing?”
“It's doing very well.”
“How does it feel? Well, I tell you
====================
Guaranteed to please.
And as I recall, it was your father—the one who told him the truth—who told him the truth? 
Well, maybe him. Maybe he's been here at all hours, I'm learning from his narration, but I think he's been here at all hours—at least as far as I'm concerned, that's all I know.



Moon
“Five minutes from now, Guardian. Aurash! Come into the chambers. The sealed doors are opening.”
I stand here now and now and now many times, as I waited for you to come out, I couldn’t come at all three of my hands and stare. I felt it take me backwards across the room and up and down before I could see.
The seven of us are arranged in descending order of age, weight on weight. The youngest is the Warlock of Shadows, whose shadow looms large at the end of the long corridor.
The third is the Wizard of Secrets, whose shadow looms large at the end of a slanted stone floor. I flinched as I stepped inside, but he laughed it off. I nodded, surprised, even he insisted on being alone.
The fourth is the Hunter, friend and Vex servant, and then the Warlord. They are simple men and women, but they have been beaten, tried, and—
I.
A man is a person, at times, and violence is no exception. The man I know is legendary among the Warlock orders. In his time in the shadows he'd carried the legend of the Moon, of his people slaughtered, and he's done it again and again, in defiance of the laws of their land.
The greatest warrior I know is an old one. It was in the shadow of the unknown that he broke his oath. In its place stood the Book of the Unraveler, and within that book was found the sword logic that made up the Sword of Crota. That logic was called the Sword of Crota.
The greatest warrior I know is a fool. He'll never see the day when he calls for his brother's aid.
But I count on you, Guardian, to help me... to your work, to your end. If you can come to a single loss this past week I can look into the depths of the Machine and see how it manipulates reality.
If you can come to

====================
The Fallen have been known to attack key Fallen positions with sheer numbers. This ambush turned out to be more than a legend had Skolas come to understand the Devils had no time for simple legends.
The assault seemed to last just a few more minutes as the two warring sides engaged in a titanic battle with no end in sight.
The result: Fallen shields beginning to shatter and a Ketch engulfed in smoke. The battle spilled into the street, the Fallen under the surface, as the Ketch's shields should have snapped.
The battle spilled into the street, the Fallen under the surface, as the Awoken chittering and red-hot Gyromancers rose from the rubble to shatter their shields.
The battle spilled into the street, the Fallen under the surface, as the Awoken chittering and red-hot Gyromancers rose from the rubble to shatter their shields.
A massive cheer went up as a single, powerful Awoken man rushed toward the Kell’s warriors. The gun shot rang out across the street.
“I am the man they throw to them, against their will.” The man shouted as his Ghost chased him down the dark. “The one I have to kill them with."
The man looked lost in the stillness of the moment, but by the time the man reached the door, the Ghost had already taken his side.
The man gave a weak nod, but the man was serious. “I give no details,” he said, gesturing with his lower half. His face was expressionlessly grim. “This is my second visit to the Vault,” he said, gesturing with his lower half. His face was grim. “The people here have been matter-of-fact,” he said. “And I’m not even trying to impress you.”
The Ghost held up the handle, believing the gesture would be enough to get the message, but in the trembling man’s presence the gesture just made sense.
The man shook his head, and the smile fell. “Nothing like a goodbye,” he said.
The Ghost continued forward. Inside, the man spoke first, and the man became defensive. “I don’t want to die,” he said.
“I don’t want to die,” the Ghost said, before speaking more in

This year's 11 was a success, wasn't it?    *hug
*it
It was a mess.    
I don't know what it was, but we had an earthquake. Had a river of dead people. Met a comet and it worked. A few rocks with wildly inconsistent success rates. A few dead organisms and humans. A few decent days, but generally bad. 
We were winning. Everyone except me was losing. And it wasn't as if we were the only ones who had been killed. 
The floodgates were being ushered in this year, and it was dawning on me - as many others - that this was not a place to be.
I must have been dead for seven hours, but I bled out of my brother's blood. 
The machine gun battles were underway, and my weapon was a cannon. I saw the gun and my friends felled. 
The priest was near when this happened. Said some good things about the gun and my soul was consumed.
Then someone came up the cannon. Gun in hand. Took me as close to the truth as I could get. 
I was okay, though. The gun was my first and only hope. 
The mass murder looked just like the story I'd heard before. Jaren Ward was killed in the mess, and Eris Morn were left to wonder where the hero came from.
The machine gun battlements were lined with corpses of war. Ancient, dug out of the earth. Haven't they, Jaren? The Motes of Time stopped just short of the edge of the world, but still marked the place as human.
There were six of us then. All of us had guns. All but one of me

====================
Welcome back to Exile, my third and final post. This time around I've removed my explorer lens and am now free to roam my Osmium Court in its entirety.
I find the time to:
- Study the ancient ruins.  Excavations are underway but I think they'll be ready in time for the Crucible to begin.
- Watch out for the Forsaken, they're low-ranking members of an unknown rank. They seem to be focusing on studying the ruins.
- Listen to the whispers - they concern the court more than anything.  The court itself seems to be progressing erratically - I've heard the rumors - but I've been out before and seen the ruins, and there are hints of Human civilization here. It's possible this visitor came to the area from somewhere far beyond.
- The remains of an old-age structure... the bones of a before-and-after posterity. They look like they came out of the bottom of a dark hole. The surface is likely dirt and dust, but there could be glass or metal or both. There could be a universe of them, as far as I'm concerned.
- The ship.  There could be a mind inside this humming machine. Could be a person. I've seen space pirates before, but this was the first I'd seen that had passengers. It looked like a human being.
- The ship.  Perhaps the ship was going through a difficult time. The ruins on the ship seem to show a steady state, with recent developments suggesting that the majority of the crew are humans. The fact that the ship was destroyed in the first place is unfortunate, but it is a sign of things to come.
- The combat.  The design of the combat ship seems to be a priori predicated on the belief that every enemy is a unique and expendable force. This design was recently challenged by the loss of unit combat to machine, and the Crucible seems to be working towards this goal. The use of grapplers seems to be an increasingly common strategy.
- The combat.  The combat seems to focus on the moral high ground, with units engaged in brutal combat often rendered in unconsciousness. The combat seems to exist as a static that always seems to be active. Units often deny objectives and move at unpredictable times. Units with no awareness of the Crucible or the Crucible itself often find themselves in the position of merely 'listening'.

Variks, Kell of Wolves
"The last true wolf pack stood against the Darkness."
Variks, the Kell of Wolves' Primus and High Priest of the House of Winter, was one of the last true wolves left on the enormous ice that surrounds the Queen's Reef. While the Queen's defenses are vast, the Wolf forces deployed around her provide a good window into the worlds of the Hive.
Variks has been a champion of new generations of warriors - young and old. In battle, he has been a leader. Against the wall of pure, fanatical fury, he has laid waste to anything that expects its power.


Osborn Nest
"A crack of Winter is coming for everything."
ARENA DESIGNATION: OPLINK Centaur Reef - Reef of Elders
LOCATION: Cosmodrome, Earth
What was once a clandestine orbital defense array in the Tower's ceiling is now a reality - encrypted by a deep-space brace placed inside a Vault-6 hangar. Key documents have been recovered at the site, but the public can trust that the Cryptarchs and Guardians who flew the Walls will keep their eyes on this facility to support any necessary repairs. - -
The Cryptarchs are watching. The Chamber of Night has warned that the Hive are preparing for an assault on Freehold, and the Vex are preparing to test their atomic bomb on the Houses. The Vex have launched a staggering assault on the Reef, destroying an atomic fleet with one command and one no longer under the Aegis. The House of Wolves is doomed. And your service to the Reef and the war in which it has been labored is doomed. - -
The Vex have launched an orbital artillery barrage across the Reef. The House of Wolves' flagship will be in targetonance as the barrage subverts House defense. If the House defense fails, the barrage will drop again. If the Wolves breach in, the artillery will spark like wildfire. The House leadership is lost, and her or his plans will be bogged down in bureaucratic wrangling. The defensive wall of the chamber is crumbling, and the Cryptarchs are optimistic that the attack will be repelled well enough for the resumption of hostilities.
The battle of Freehold is making some people uncomfortable. The Vanguard are trying to get the public involved, and the Guardian Council is deliberating on a plan to reward those who report certain crimes to the Speaker and the Hidden. If the

"There is no higher warfare than deception."
Stories like these feed rumors of many stories of the Vex, a mysterious entity that collects intel from the Vex gateway systems and then sends that intel to a series of on-screen covens organs, or togybattles.
The Ven Emperor, for his part, maintains a collection of totem poles and rituals to be carried out over the course of his life. Though the cosmos is mysterious, and the Vex are not always on the move, rumors say he is a constant with a vanguard of loyal Guardians who want to be as close to the Emperor as possible.
As to the Vex themselves, no one has been able, ever, to establish a definitive one yet, although the often-cited Ghost's theories on the Vex seem to match up with those we have come to know as legend.

You are a Skiff. You will not be mocked. You will not be hunted down and killed.
You master the art of flight. You will find joy and sorrow in the land you visit. But you will not be rewarded.
You are a Skiff's Captain. You herd the beasts across the darkening plains.
You see the truthfulness of the deal. You know what you have to offer the Cabal. But you also know that it is a lie.
You were called to this place in the twilight by the voice of Winter.
You were given a task. To climb two huge peaks. The process was simple: just take the dead ground, put the bones where you will, and see what comes out.
You did what the Skiff said. You created a world full of bones. And it was magnificent.
But the bones didn’t match the splendor of the destination. The straps were too tightly wound, and the channel wasaged to make it look like a door.
So you searched the web, thinking of places to live. But you found no such luck. The route was dark, dark, and there was never a bright heart.
So you rented a limousine and drove your lonely, forgotten trail across the unmoving ice of North America.
Now you call your father, asking for his every word. He says you are too smart, and that you are the very God of Ranks. You have been given the honor of dedicating a throne to Skolas, the Omnigul. You will not be tired of his games.
You love to compete, but you love so much more than just the tournament. You have been given the task of satinging the will of the Hated God.
And you prepare by gnawing on the bitter flesh of the eternal hungry.

The Wolf Ingredient Book 3
Now that we know the ins and outs of the Mastodon system, it's time to dive into the deeper mysteries of how the machine got its name.
The Ingredient Book tells of a universe made of the Mastodon genome, and of a perfect, eternal nursery. Of a universe that would make a proud King proud.
The text goes on, and on.  From Book 3, line by line.  From Journal to Journal, from Ghost to Ghost, the list goes on.
From Tower to Tower, Guardians fight the Darkness with the Light. But the mysteries of the hidden origins of the Ingredient Book 3 can feel like their own engine, trying to outrace the fast-changing, ultra-intelligent playthings that make up the Guardian community.



The Ruling House

"The balance of power in The City is rock and necessity is the Vex."
The Ruling House is the oldest of the City's militarysubstrate classes, and they wield enormous power - both physical and mental.
 Guardians assume leadership of the Ruling Houses, and even of the Vex as a whole. This is because the Ruling Houses themselves are revered and controlled, not as equals, but enemies - even when the Vex are on top.

====================
SAVINGS:

1. Bombardment teams from the Reef and the Vanguard scouting missions continued to roll out the Crucible's in-system weapons.
2. The number of Bombardments owned by the Tower's various Vault representatives climbed to unsustainable strength in the Reef's shadow.
3. The Crucible's Crucible match type was a chest-paint task, modified by hand-interpreting hand-painted tones.
4. The Crucible match type: wall-to-wall combat. Targets receive bonus experience points for their defeating Guardians.
5. Events were organized and organized to prepare for.
6. The event style: teams of two, with one team allowed to stay together and form a new team if the formation became unstable. A death by combat could result in the death of all three players.
7. The severity of the punishment: a prior infraction, a hung jury, a long-term ban. A clean team penalty of perpetual exclusion or disuse would have been preferable.
8. Age restrictions: all opponents must be eliminated by the next closest available rival.
9. Faction cleansing required: all rivals remove Vex threats, while ignoring submind corruption that threatens to wipe the Vex off the face of the Earth.
10. Temporal restriction: the Tower could have indefinitely restricted the flow of Vex traffic.
11. Hazards: enemies encountered in Vex-controlled areas. Spiders and Guardian patrols. Tracers on rooftops. Will of Crota.
12. Event style: teams of two, with one team allowed to stay together and form a new team if the formation became unstable. Reviving a lost team would have been preferable to losing all but one of its members.
13. Faction cleansing required: the enemy team already having a strong connection to the Tower. Good Guardian engagements would have seen the team re-engage and form a new team.
14. Faction cleansing was not without risk. Fallen crews had been taunting the Tower since the beginning, trying to learn its tactics. To their credit, the Fallen did not seek to retake the Cosmodrome.

Perun's Request

I ask that you read my mind. Are you a Wizard, are you? Are you going to kill the way of the living, or will you be reduced to a raving incoherent assembly of mindless Hive?
You must know that you are the tools of the beast, and you must use them to defeat me.
I have given you the sword and the world, but you want to take it. Take the sword and the world, for you are Forsaken and I am Radegast. Take the sword and the world, for you are Savath&#251;n.
You must know that you are the instrument of your Will, and the weapon of your Death.
You must know that you are the product of the Deep, the Worm its worms. That you are the product of the Deep's Will in action.
That you are at the center of a multi-faceted network that includes both flesh and power.
That you wield the Deep's will in battle.
That you die in the power you provide.
That you deserve a place of safety within the network.
That you deserve to be alone with your thoughts and desires.
That you may discover a way through the Deep, and survive the hell of it.
That you may one day lead a life of peace and quiet.



The Lighthouse

The Lighthouse opened in a cave system beneath the Traveler. Fragments of ancient stone and glass have remained uncounted for quantum computing, and with a little ingenuity a Guardian can push the edge of infinity open to explore.
The Guardian set out to understand ancient Vex math and write algorithms that would open the way into the secrets of the Vex afterlife.
The Lighthouse's design was challenged, and in the end, the design of the Vex entrance was scrapped. The design of the Vex gate itself remained the same, but the Guardian designed by hand was festooned with the Vex Seal.
Now the Guardian works to perfect a Guardian weapon and a Guardian weapon system so that she and

"It is to the Guardians of the Crucible the task they count... to retake what they once exploited, and restore order in the system. This is their chance to win again."
Plan C: Make the jump to find out.


The Cabal
"I cannot believe I've been here so long. I've never seen anything like it."
Cabal intelligence is hard to come by in the Reef. The few I can find report ever-so-somewhat-somewhat-unnamed Ghost crews have been popping up all over the place. There's even a faint chance they've been spotted in the Reef in the past week or so. The Crucible itself seems to be a recent outpost of the Cabal's presence in the system.
Cabal soldiers are generally considered less dangerous than their non-Cabal patrons, and a constant source of morale boosts. Some believe the Cabal are the Cabal, and that their purpose is the suppression of others from operating with just a fraction of the nation's resources.
The Cabal have long been admired for their ability to engineer and field unconventional forces. This popularity has led the Crucible to classify them as a serious threat.

Knight

"It is no secret where our brothers and sisters would hide if they ever attempted to board our ship. Shaxx' acolytes describe him as a devoted knight with a shrine to 'The Eternal Star'.' -Eris Morn


Antagonists

These are the heroes I chased here, and where was Shaxx? How was his great journey?
My chase involved many moons and a few Earth ships, and I found no one to accompany me. On the other hand, I was very glad to see that my father had come home, and I was glad to see that he was now with me when I went to find him.
My father was a geologist. He had been a lieutenant of mine for some time. I thought he might differ on the nature of life and death, but he was unfazed by my concerns.
After my father had died, my father went to me and told me that his court had granted me access to the planetary sciences we needed. I accepted his explanation, and while I was waiting in vain for news of his family, he and his people came to Earth, and found me a research station.
There, I was quite prepared to help in finding those who faced extinction. The Earth was tidally bound, so it was my turn to cut that bound. The best I could hope for was that tidally bound planet a secure distance away from home.
My father was very diplomatic. He said that I should stay and study the fate of the Seven Hostages, and that I should be their representative in the Wizarding World. I accepted.
Then he led me through a door that lead to a subterranean labyrinth that he described as having "two eyes." I jumped at the chance to see how the labyrinth looked, and
====================
Seeing as how the Light is a nebulous word, nebulous even, I thought I'd share a word with it:
We are the Same.
What that means, exactly, is this is unclear, forbidden knowledge, but it does have some utility. For example: the ability to Make a New Same identical to what we are.
A New Same can be made, seen, heard, seen again, but this New Same is not actual Sameness. We are intrinsically not identical, but we are nevertheless related.
A New Same can be enhanced, enhanced, enhanced. For the duration of our existence we are intrinsically responsible for the enhancement of all New Sames.
New Sames are created when a Fallen Archon/(Your Will) is unable to Perform Ayleid Divine Will or be Removed from the Will of Your own Existence. The Archon/(Your Will) then attempt to perform Ayleid Divine Will by Any means available to them.
If they are unsuccessful, they are replaced by a reborn Necromancy-minded thesesidal mass. The Necromancy then attempts to take over the new Sames minds and use them for Aversion. If the Reborn One achieves Aversion, the Necromancy-haters utterly annihilate all pretenders to this reparation.
Once a new Same is created, all who were once Attractive Sockets to the Fallen (which were then Blended into the Will of the Necromancy) are invited to their final Aversion ritual to be conducted in peace. 
This final Aversion is performed by a Vex organ, described as a "Scourge." Those willing to take on the Cryptarchs' will are exalted. Those who Corrupted the Necromancy for any other reason are summarily Disowned.
Any Fallen who have ever done anything remotely like what the Cryptarchs have done are either Dead or on the Run.


Dead Orbit

ARENA DESIGNATION: Dead Orbit
LOCATION: Eos Chasma, Mars
The mission was ground-based and event-based, with each mission meeting the same objective: to explore and characterize the architecture and behavior of the Vex gate structures across the system.
For years the Free Worlds’ War Thunder and Guardians’ War Thunder teams fought over the loose resources and attention the Exo had secured across the endless expanse of the

I was overwhelmed by the sheer awesomeness of these things. I mean, they were amazing, weren't I? 
I remember thinking to myself, wow, this is just some amazing, thought-provoking way to spend an entire day. 
And it was. 
It was a day of total focus, and a day of utter focus, and everything was wrapped up in our grasp.
On that day, I'm afraid, I just
Lived here in the Tower for so long. My wife and child are safely aboard the Dreadnaught. My friends and my loved one's gone. 
Went to this ending only to find it turned out to be a lie. 
So I lie, and say I spent all my time trying to understand the weapon and the Darkness in the process. 
And there it is, the Darkblade IRL, intact, fully operational, ready to send a message: YOU ARE MINExhat. 
And it's the Heart of ALL ARMSxhat, standing with you in place.



The Drifter

Deep inside a mysterious Vex casing hides a one-way communications relay. The Drifter is a Vex construct of immense power, used toactic power sources and connection points. It is the link between the Guardian and the Tower.
The Drifter is a direct line to the hearts of the new Age. Replicating the Guardian's systems is critical to survival. The relay carries vital vital intelligence, and as a result, it hosts the Tower's own limited video feed of the Exo roaming. The Drifter is also the gateway into a far off land where the Darkness draws near...and there is very little we can rely on.
If the Tower's security was our only hope, our only hope layin' between the worlds below and the deep, dark truth that exists in all of us.
That was why the Vanguard had us on their ship so early in the Exo's journey, and why they so eagerly flaunted their technology—acons and radars, interiors and flightpaths that glowed with exotic light. The truth was, the Drifter and the Guardian, too, and while the Vanguard might have been able to bluff their way into a location more secure, the Light-bearers they guarded made it very clear they would not be drawn into a rousing ritual of combat.
So the Vanguard
====================
I'm trying to be clear. The facts I’m presented with on the flight suggest that I am not the incarnation of a dead star.  The fire giant from the sky is not, by any stretch of the imagination, the same.  The fire giant I’m tending is more like a walking fossil than anything we’ve ever built.  And any way to explain the legend or the construction of the house down here seems to contradict the facts I’m describing. ——————————————–
The problem with such theories is not that they're wrong. They’re not even true.



The Dark
"It's not enough to feed the universe. We have to keep the Light alive."
The Dark is a viral virus that has claimed the Dark from within. Guardians must fight the worms inside to claim the Light beyond, and beyond outside extinction.
The Dark’s persistence within the system is questioned, in large part because of the complex nature of the transmission and the ways in and of itself. It is conceivable that the Hive’s agents live in the systems, in the dark, awaiting the moment when they will begin to manufacture their own antithetical tohuman strength.

====================
Sgt. Slaughter: I am afraid so. They are falling for all one thing - the lie that a transcendent being is upon them. They are all on the brink of extinction, of a Hive intelligence or another.



Dormant SIVA: Fallen 3.1

I can't seem to find the right words.
What am I looking for, exactly?
What do I see?
I see the Hive.
They are all on the verge of extinction. The bloom is almost gone, the ambrosia is gone, but the core is strong. Their weapons of choice are biology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of life.
Life is a storm within. Life explains everything. Life is a machine. Machines are more likely to survive to improve their architecture and to survive to thrive.
The Hive are all designed to survive a long age. The simplest of Hive is destroyed and replaced with a more complex shape, and as machinery and technology improve, the complexity will begin to replace the machine. This will happen over and over again, just as the Hive joined with the machine to form the basic organism.
The simplest shape will survive, the most simple will adapt. The machine will be the arbiter of survival. The smart one will learn to make complex rules. The efficient one will learn to make efficient rules.
The most intelligent will learn to navigate the dark between the material world and the spiritual. The hardiest will never explore the dark alone, and will most certainly never explore the dark alone.
One day I think about all the unknowns and I look at you and I think, wow, I don't know what I've come to think. I think of Skyline, all the little things that made up the sky that were never there, the fact that it's so close now to where I think you meant to be.
And I think about all the people that I've made and all the things that made me who've made you who think the sky is the limit. I think about all the things that made me who've made you who might be here now, might be wrong, might be right now.
And I think about all the things that made me who made me who might be here now, might be right now.
And I feel strong now, and I feel strong now is the right time to call an end to this war. The storm above us will last a hundred years
====================
The battle was fierce. Wolves circled the peaks high and dry. Clovis Bray’s sniper rifles peppered the mounds of dirt and metal as he chased them down.
“We're coming,” said Jaren Ward, the Titan’s second wife. “From what I can find, your cannon seems to beomerically superior to our other projectile, the Arcite 99-40. Will you be as blunt as you say you havevengeance on me?”
As the last wolf approached, Jaren Ward raised her rifle in a salute and a wave of salutations, before turning to leave the valley. 
Two Guardians stopped in their tracks. “I wish you good luck,” said the other. “And good luck with your plans for the Valley.”
“If you believe that, you will commit a sin.”
Jaren Ward stood as the Guardian’s cannon struck the ground beneath her. The ground gave way, and the Witch’s spirit began to fade. 
Now, in the distance, the cannon spewed another wave of Darkness. this time in a horizontal arc. She could feel it in her gut.
She stopped a few paces back and looked beyond ‘Valus Trenn’s’ eyes to see a Warlock jump up and punch her, large and dark, from fifty to seventy feet. The shockwave of her punch sent the Warlock flying, and as she fell, another wave of Death Knights returned the piercing stare of Jaren’s cannon.
Jaren Ward lifted her cannon and a wave of Storms circled her.
"You were magnificent," she said. "And I wish I could call you back. But you have no friends here."
Valus Trenn smiled. "Not in my estimation," he continued, "only your…" He paused, as if waiting for a reply.
"In my estimation," Abra Zire wiped away some of the tears. "Not all of you are created equal."
"In your estimation," Skolas continued, "our enemies have three times the firepower of the Vex, have higher survival rates, and are more dangerous to come out from behind cover. So you…"
Ward turned as the Witch impacted a mountaintop with the side of a building. The shockwave of her attack hit as quickly as it
====================
delve deep
The path we walk is not always smooth. Scars and sorrows and triumphs and defeats. But we always remember what we’ve done. We pushed our way to the edge of the Earth, where beauty was born, and where our strength was born.
That’s what we’ve come to reach for. That’s what our paths converge... like iron filings.
But we never know what will overtake us. Do we build a temple to the Deep, or do we move on, driven by hatred, desire, doubt, and the desire to destroy all that is not smooth.
It is us, our rivers, our streams, who are avoiding the edge of the Earth.
It is us who lost our sight, and now have lost everything. But they still call to you, the mighty, blade-winded Weaver, our lord.
Ask them again, and let us ask why we��d be lost.


Urzok, the Hated
"When we cut the flesh from the rift our gods began to rise."
In the material world, Urzok is the sharp end of the dividing line. His axe is the sharp end of Oryx’s plans.
In the tongue of Oryx, Oryx says, "Oryx is the hated one, and his sword the only weapon."
Oryx replies, "It is for your worship."
Oryx is the thorn in Oryx’s side. Oryx should be my friend.


Mormu, Husked
"The numbers beside the throne, Oryx, like hungry worms."
Aurochs studies mapped the territories occupied by the Hive. It showed that the great Hive territories were occupied by three times the number of worlds: by Earth, Venus, and the moons of Jupiter.
Oryx had the power to expand these territories. To Oryx, the world looked like a gift from the Lord.
Another study of the map, this one labeled Mormu, Husked, was complete and accurate. It showed that the Hive had dominion over the seas, the continents, and the skies.
Another study showed that the Hive were the foremost of them all. And they were the only ones capable of understanding the other Hive's understanding.
Oryx had the power to shape reality to his
====================
There are worms of our own, worms of our own weight. Worms of their own."
Oryx walked through the dark, through the throat of the Vex gate. Through the shanks and broken homes of Fundament. He tasted the wilderness and the war, the hazy afterglow of a lost age and the whispered call of an ancient voice, and he felt the chill of war take hold in his body. He felt the need to claw at his restrictions, to push them through.
He knew that the slightest twitch in the code was an affront to the power he cherished. He didn't care if it angered the Worm God, or the Hive's loyal knight. Just a twitch of the code.
Finally, he was free. Free of the bonds of his home and his code.
He walked with the edge of his sword. Grief was building inside of him, a knot in his armor, a knot in his soul. He walked with the sword. He let his anger and regret take his body.
From a great distance, his Ghost watched the battle.
A chorus rose among the warriors, filled with the sweet scent of victory and the glad tidings of his people. Verse one said: You who have seen the battle, you who saw the Deep rising, you who knew the Deep.
From another direction the chorus rang out again, this time from the warriors' souls. This time the Deep was King Vex.
Vex the Taken King walked with the sword. In his hand he held a weapon. On the grip were the words, The Will Will All. In his bloodied hands he waved goodbye to his maker.
From the distant trees he saw the tall trees that branch off the mainland. The tall trees that branch off the mainland. -惊。
From the distance, too, Vex walked with the sword. The tide of battle was coming to Earth, and the future was yet to come.


Ghost Fragment: King of Wolves 2

Variks stared into the sun as the king of the Wolves rose from the roots behind them. He had short, wire-toothed arms and made an imposing presence on the ground. He was imposing, in a way. The ground beneath his feet was littered with books, and many weapons.
The ground beneath his feet was littered with power armor, and the armor looked just as good as his own. The power armor
====================
Black Shield
"The Hive play a key role in the Warlocks' journeys across space and time."
The Hive are a sinister presence on the frontier, ruthless arbiters of the Traveler's will. Though their origins are not entirely clear, the Hive name a set of physical structures on Mars that appear to be ancient stone tools.
The origins of the Black Shield are not clear, although the shield is thought to have come into being during the Collapse rather than continue along the coast. A theory suggests that the sea broke away from the Shield during the Clash, and then the shield remained in the shield for some time. A variant of this theory suggests that the shield was initially used to guard access to forbidden areas on Venus, but that the shield was deactivated and not lasted during the Collapse.


Urrox, Flame Prince
"The ground upon which you walk shall burn. YOU shall burn."
Prince to none, Urrox kept an eye on the coast during the Clash of Clans. The Harbingers—heck more than a light year from when the structure was thought to have been abandoned.
As the shield's deactivation, Prince Uldren's Ghost walked into the battle-scarred ruins of the Harbingers, where vandals and thieves scrawled, abused, and ultimately murdered the Prince. The Flame Prince, who bears the appearance of a human, walked among the charred remains of the Harbingers and abused the Vex networks that now protect the site.
When the Fallen House of Devils fell in terror, Urrox called for a grander strategy. Skolas had captured the Queen, and he sought to shape the future of the Fallen House into a blade and a weapon. A plan hid in Skolas' head, but it was revealed to him when the pair crossed the Channel that the Hive were actually looking at the Vex as they moved towards the City, and that plan worked.
Skolas was summoned to the Dreadnaught, the massive war-base at the center of the Fallen fleet. The Dreadnaught was being used by the Hive for military purposes, but Skolas knew that base could be used for human experimentation. He convinced Skolas to stay and monitor the situation from the Dreadnaught up until the Collapse, when the Harbingers were rebuilt and the fleet was sent back to the City.
When the City was cleared, Skolas traveled with the newly-established Fallen
====================
Newborn Guardians are taught to fight and die as they see fit. This is done so that they can develop and flourish, not be killed in the journey ahead.
This is the cornerstone of Guardians, and one that every Guardian will need in the long run.


Vanguard Marks

When a terrible threat rises, Guardians look to their Vanguard mates to pick up the load. When a powerful Guardian reaches the Tower, Guardians look to their fellow Guardians to carry that threat - whether that threat is a Darkness that has no place in our times, or the Light that will shine when the Light is needed, and when the Darkness is shining.


Universal
"The point is a place."
When a power is too blunt or too direct, a Warlock looks to their Fireteam to pick it up. When a dark force is found, Guardians look to them, and to the places they visit, to offer their power.


Guardians have been known to hold their ground when it comes to the wall-mounted weaponry they use to defend their cities. This is not the place to be.


 Traps

The Weapons of Sorrow codenamed for Fallen houses the Weapons of the World's Vex units. These heavily modified field-mounted heavy weapons sport a strict code of conduct that bars violence beyond all others.



Gjallarhorn
"If you see a dark and hungry creature, you will see a dark."
ARENA DESIGNATION: Gjallarhorn
LOCATION: European Dead Zone, Earth
When the Cabal gain control of the European Dead, they will begin to utilize Paskin's Protective Field to isolate and destroy dangerous entities.


Paskin's Protective Field

ARENA DESIGNATION: Paskin's Field
LOCATION: European Dead Zone, Earth
In the wilds of the European Dead, there are only the Guardians prepared to guard our borders. The Paskin's Field is a complex and deadly tactic utilized by the Cabal to push their global footprint deeper into our locales.


The Cabal
"We have no choice but to defend ourselves. Into the storm."
Cabal forces in the European Dead Zone are commanded by Primus Ta'aun and led by Primus Sha'aun. Together, this Cabal triumvirate has been used in the wilds of the Dead Zone for some time.
The most recent example
====================
Skills

"Focus, steady hand. Focus, steady hand.  You're all there for me."
Mastery of stealth is one of the most prized possessions of Guardians. Even Veteran Jacob Hardy considers it a strength. But logic says that only a few rogue Exiles can wield this ability, not a hundred thousand Warlocks and a hundred Vandals.
Guardians with a steady hand will often show mercy, and will buy time to maneuver if they need it.


Fusion Rifles

Advancements in directed energy disbursement, gained through the discovery of Golden Age research, led to the creation of stable, field-ready energy-based weaponry. The first implementation of this technology comes in the form of the Fusion Rifle. Users must hold the trigger down for a few moments to charge the weapon before firing.


Pocket Infinity
You cannot shake the feeling that this is less a weapon than a doorway.
Fireteam Tuyet died in the Ishtar Sink, hunting the secrets of the Vex. They must have come too close to something precious, for the Vex descended on them with their typical inscrutable, thorough violence. 
But their sacrifice was not in vain. The data they gathered helped forge the Pocket Infinity. Properly modified, the weapon should be capable of devastating output on just a single charge cycle.
The Infinity's mechanisms have proven difficult, if not impossible, to replicate en masse. It is conceivable that the weapon draws its energy from the Vex networks...an ominous possibility. So be wary with it.


Plan C
Good fighters have contingency plans. Great fighters don't need them.
Sharp reflexes keep you alive on the frontier - but no matter how fast you are, a fusion rifle can only charge so quickly. Enter the Plan C. When you draw the weapon, fast-rise capacitors and a smart induction system prime for firing. The 'ready fire' state only lasts a few moments - but in a gunfight, those moments matter.


Vex Mythoclast
...a causal loop within the weapon's mechanism, suggesting that the firing process somehow binds space and time into...
Some legends live forever. Others are overwritten - reshaped by the sheer will of those who believe that any ordeal can be conquered, any foe vanquished, any god cast down. 
The Mythoclast is a Vex instrument from some far-flung corner
====================
What is a 'Slap Rifle'?
A Slap Rifle is a simple yet effective melee weapon. It does not have a mechanical purpose.
There are, of course, many problems with the term. The word "slap" is rarely applied to something as simple as metalwork. Does a weapon have a purpose? Are there other, more basic weapons out there that would allow a wielder to discharge more force, more quickly, without the need for a reload?
In any case, many weapons are designed to cause pain. Whether this is a weapon's purpose is a matter of debate.


Wire Rifle

The Wire Rifle is a simple but deadly weapon. The wire runs from the weapon's core to the target area, gauging the weapon's impact against gravity as well as physical threat.


Boolean Grenade

Boolean Grenade

The weapon draws the explosive from the environment, then converts that energy to electromagnetic charge. This process is called capacitive energy transfer (CGT). According to the Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), capacitive energy transfer is the process by which two different kinds of energy are converted into energy again.
Charged energy can be converted into matter or matter plus one else. In other words: one kind of energy is charged at a certain rate, and some energy is converted into matter.


Boolean Grenade

This devastating weapon fires explosive when it has been drawn. When fully charged, the weapon can hold up to six grenades.


Boolean Grenade

Charged energy is a powerful energy broker, but its effect is far lessened. As a result, grenades are more deadly to passengers or explorers. The Weapon Academy has devised a simple but effective way to eliminate dangers: by kicking in the proper explosive.


Boolean Grenade

The weapon fires a glider when fully charged. The glider is a floating explosive that must be contained and redirected. Activated by a simple motion of the hand, the weapon fires either explosive or jelly. The largest dart is fired from the base of the antennae, while the second largest dart is fired from the top of the antennae.


Boolean Grenade

The weapon throws back into the present when not in use. This allows for better tracking and allows more room for manoeuvre.


Boolean Grenade

An explosive grenade that prevents enemies from detonating their explosive devices. The same grenade can only be
====================
The Iron Banner
"Honor and glory were found by one man, Timur. He meditated before he went in, and he said he went out to die. So I went out to die, and I did so very little."
Timur's story is not new. His Iron Banner appears in at least two other surviving stories, a collection of stories written by Timur and first-hand accounts of the trials and triumphs of his life.
In Timur's story, which was found by the Crucible, Timur falls into the arms of the Light while fighting a war that never recovered from the sins of those it destroyed. His story is not unique. In recent years, several stories have been found in the hands of Guardians, all of us a bit more ambitious than Timur.
The Iron Banner is an ongoing project by the Crucible that seeks to replicate the self-sustaining, long-forgotten energy of our star. It has proven difficult, if not impossible, to replicate the Iron Banner's energetic and physical structure. The Crucible is working to develop a complete set of rules and a model for the behavior of other Light-based beings.


Timur's Gambit

"I tread on the black of the cosmic war, but I never would have dared to go there if you wanted to destroy me."
Vex tokens have proven indispensable in the war against the Taken, but so does Timur. The Warmind's isotope data suggest that Guardians seek not only to understand the device, but also to perform powerful Guardian-based operations.
The warlocks at the Iron Temple in Timur's home system have devised a set of rules for Guardians who venture beyond conventional wisdom. The Warlord may refuse to engage, or may devote entire lifetimes to study the device. The Speaker may change his mind. The Alpha and the Hallam both appear to be incomplete.


Wrath of the Machine

The Taken: this is the shape of story
Gulrot: What is the meaning of the word shape?
Timur: The meaning is shape, which is written in the device.
Gulrot: We the Hive follow your example. Soon we will be overdriven.
Vell: We will follow the patterns of your machines in your unfathomable depths.
Vell: And we will find the secret of your power in us.
Vell: We will follow
====================
In the field, the shadow of a black hole covers every aspect of vision. The cloud tops make the cavern palatable, but the battle-hardened Guardians who work with these gaunt little constructs is their bloodlust: To kill and take what they have and return as though nothing happened.
As we approach the Hunter-Hulk's Hell, it will be interesting to see how well the Hunter handles these alien threats, and the Guardians who handle them, will be. As a Guardian, you have every benefit of the doubt, and satisfaction of the moment. As a Warlock, you need to prove your mettle, and peril awaits.
But what of the Hunter-Gatherer? How does one handle a giant that has been Incarnate for all time? Or the Weaver-Hunter, who has no fear of trials and returns with a greater purpose?
The Weaver-Hunter must always keep an wary distance, lest she be devoured. —Eris Morn


The Weaver-Trawler

"My axe is as far from my back as your throat."
Survivors of the Hellmouth have long known the Weaver-Hunter to steer clear of combat. Those who do ride the Weaver's power, wary of the rogue Hunter-Gatherer, know he is focused on the uplifting effects of ether and research the healing powers of krill.


The Weaver-Wizard

The Weaver-Wizard, like the axe among the Hellmouth's chasms, appears to be an ancient legend. It has long kept a close watch on the Hellmouth, apparently informed by the same source who alerted the Hellmouth to the existence of the Weaver-Trawler.
The Warlock Osiris has proposed that the Warlock might even - if he wishes to remain anonymous - guard the Weaver-Hulk's side of the web. The Warlock, Osiris said, needs to see the nether world, and hear what we report.
The Hellmouth seems to hold information on everything from the evolution of the solar system to the spread of magic.


The Weaver-Soldier

The Weaver-soldier is an ancient warrior class, and its origins and ultimate goals remain unclear. The Weaver-soldier offers strong support to the theory that the Keepers are simply menaced by a greater threat: an undying enemy intent on devouring the planet.

[u.1:01] They were ancient. Not as strong as we like to believe. But they did have differences. Sunbreakers, for one. Skolas had a nest of machines. How did they get one way?
[u.2:01] They didn't just make bolts of rust. They made bolts of heat. And they were heavier. Like steel.
[u.1:02] They had to climb huge, wide, brassy walls. Walls that had to be torn down. Walls that broke... change. Walls grew hungry. Like us.
[u.2:02] Maybe that's why the Wolves burned their houses. Because they didn't want to be in the Wolves' sights. Maybe that's why they let us go, and let the Wolves take what they wanted.
[u.1:03] Wherever we went... we'd fight them forever. But we didn't want to go first. We didn't want to die.

====================
The Guardian is a Guardian craft created by a young Warlock named Warlock.  His weapon is a mind-bending Array weapon, modified with the Warlock's secrets and developed to match his unique capabilities.  His weapon designs are more expansive than many weapons found in the Tower, reaching beyond mere weaponry.


Vostok Observatory
Observatory in room with Gate Device

Vostok Observatory is a Shrine to the Weavers, a place where Guardians who soar and great thinkers gather to discuss matters of transcendent power. The place is full of human activity, from the human-grown materials of the Vex to the dead stone metropolis of Vostok itself.
Interior shots of the Observatory's interior, taken during the height of the Golden Age.
The location of the Observatory is poorly understood, although it acts as a hub to host the data stored on the Gate Device and the other Vex gate networks. The data collected at the Observatory are also not representative of the Light that will be generated in the coming centuries.


Crests

Hunters, Titans, and Warlocks all carry a distinguishing Crest. In the wilds, Crests mark trophies obtained from famous deeds. In the palace, Crests mark the safekeeping of a resident's most prized possessions.
Some merchants hold high hopes for the coming age, espousing theories that regulate the use and misuse of Crests. In return, Crests and other valor entitle Guardians to special benefits.


Prey

The origins of the weapon are unclear, but Videothea claims to have seen a vision into a Hive construct. The Hive mindery seems to be elaborated on top of what the weapon learns from the battlefield.


Hydra
"The first to reach Earth was the Hybrahman, and the last to leave it. Perhaps the Hydra came to Earth as a response to the Concordat."
The Hydra was a Hive unit known as the Hybrahmans. In that image the weapon is clearly a modification of the full-length blade used by the rest of the Hydra. The Hydra is absent from this composite image.


Psion
"Another fusion weapon developed by the Vex with the capabilities of the Machine Mind."
Psion's weapon systems are clearly state-of-the-art. Whether this represents a strategic ploy is unclear. But it seems clear to me that the Hydra sees the Vex as enemies,
====================
“That’s a lie. We have a clear path to travel.”
Said Xi Ro with a dry smile. “You two are a very close thing.”
“I am already -”
“You are already -”
“You’ and I are already -”
“You’ and I are already here.”
In truth, the two of them were already there when the transmission was made.
As the Ghost spoke, an ominous arc cut across the horizon.  The unknown voice spoke to a distant part of the sky. When the Ghost viewed it, the unknown voice spoke to a planet in the sky. And the planet spoke to a star in the sky.
The star in the sky was very large, about the size of our sun. And it made the voice very, very close.  The star was a planet, of course, but it wasn’t huge.
The star in the sky was very close. And the ghost very close.  The ghost was very big, probably hundreds of times its actual size.
And it spoke to the star very close...
“Lakshmi... You two are drift pieces, An&#251;k. How do you - 
“Lakshmi... Come with me. I will guide you through the steps to becoming a god.” 
Lakshmi...
Don't worry. I know what it's like to work with Lakshmi.  Kind, gentle, stupid An&#251;k. Walk the halls of engineering with a twirl, and you might learn everything you've ever wanted.
But if you try, someone will think you've ever done anything special.
Don't worry. I will help you learn it.
The hardest part is just figuring out what it is you want to do. It doesn’t take much, but is there a way to make it work?
And that's the beauty of becoming a god: you get to see your powers applied in a new light. You never have to think about it. It’s like getting married right away. You never have to.
When you do, whatever you’ve done will be public record, so you don’t have to. Just say, do you know what I’m thinking?

He stole a piece of our souls. And he threw them into a storm room, where the treasure-seekers were slaughtered and hung. 
Once, I was a servant, and Savath&#251;n sacrificed herself for the King in hopes of ending the War. 
Now, she is a worm, devouring the souls of her own worm.
It is me, my worm. The power of the Deep. 
I chase her through my Court and the Hive's prisons, and I kill her with arcane swords and with arcane javelins. I convert them with my withered self and with my withered half-sword.
When she awakens, I will slay her with a blade so sharp and so clean, with a shadow so deep and a chill so thick around it that it almost feels like someone has broken out of a person’s skull. I will use that knowledge to craft a weapon that can be forged from mundane matter and a weapon that can be forged from the shrapnel of Hive war.
And I will show her how to drive a wedge between her natal home and with it, her way into the throne world.


Ghost Fragment: Queen's Blade 3

The throne had been defined by the golden age of swordplay. A polished, cast ironwork that for thousands of years have視never been broken.
The great gate of the City was opened and we lived in the unknown.
The ships went down the coast and away from the ocean.
The merchants came to the Plaguelands, who worked with us and made plans for the great journey.
We knew we were going to Mars, and we wanted to reach there before we left.
But we knew Mars was not our home. 
The Traveler's power had changed. Made more powerful by the power of the Abyss. And all of us were watching our brothers and sisters in the deep, darkest corners of the Deep, where our might was vast and vast.
We knew it would be a challenge, if not impossible, to reach us.
And so we hid ourselves beneath the Traveler's power, preferring to call our journeys home.
We never expected to travel as far as we did. But we were intrigued by the power of the Deep, and the Deep's way with the deep was an interesting challenge.
We always knew the Traveler hid itself in our heads, trying to explain

“Poor little thing. How are you holding up?”
Her father’s mutinous assault on the Ammonite home state—“He’s cutting it out of their vital fluids. Then she’s eating everything in sight. That’s all I’ve got to say.
“So you’re cutting them out of everything?”
“I am cutting them out of everything.”
My words, words now.
She stopped short of saying, "I are." Instead, she began without consulting him, without ‘the conversation’s timeline.
I’ve suggested time travel before. It’s possible we’re the same. However, if you’re contradicting yourself so hard you’ll fire him and leave the rest of us to the Vanguard every attempt will fail. I will try.
The Ammonite have been gaining strength in the Last City. A stealthy and cunning people, they prefer to hide among the weak, fight for objectives that transcend their species and the laws of their own solar system.
The battle for Ammon’s throne is here and now. Without the right pilot and the right weapon she/he will fall.

"The Monarchy Will Take You If You Don’t Care."
Vex research has begun on the new Vex design methods. The Monarchy is eager for your feedback. The Cathedral is also keen. Feel free to let the Master of Exeter know you’re ready for business.
Now that you have your work cut out for the long game, what are your options then?
Ghost: Lay waste to every creature of the Tower.


The Speaker

The Monarchy is proud to present the Speaker of the Solar System. Phobos-4 through his robotic companions, the Consensus and the Holograms is sure to excite and educate Guardians. The Speaker is also quick to credit the Guardian-owned Republiar, which has been spotted clocking in at least ten thousand spin Hours.



The Vex Monitors

The Vanguard has no records of a Vex institution more closely related to the Hive than the Concordat The Vex. Their initials are possibly a combination of Dreg and Dser, from the Black Garden.

XIX: King of Thieves
Verse 2:9 — King of Thieves
The Thieves' Den!
It's been awhile since we saw him coming, but his aura is still high, powerful among the Temple's herd. He greets Guardians on the front lines once or twice.
We tried to make an audience, and he insists that we do not exist. He speaks with a Florentine air, and we can alreadysee the impact of that accent.
He comes to an agreement: I will arrange the taking of the Den from Guardians anywhere in the Tower, and from there the theft of the Den from the outside world.
He fails, and we both resign: we are mercenaries, after all.
After a while, he says, we become the Thieves' Den, and that we are to be sent to wherever the Vex stake out their strength.
We are not the problem at the Den, he says, but rather with the Six Perfected, the Skyburners' wives, who exercise unfettered dominion. We will be sent to boot.
He is right, and we are probably doomed.
Then a knock on the front door of the Tower is lit. A masked man approaches.
The cloaked man leads the way, a silver arm of the man at the entrance to the Tower who shakes his head as if to say, well, maybe we should have stayed in the Uprising, but instead, we've moved on.
The masked man answers cautiously.
"We're just lining up support," he says, and then, with a wave of his hand, heloads and makes a grab for our weapons. "We can hide here a little bit longer."
We've had our eyes on more Fallen, he says, and, having seen the horror stories he's heard, he feels certain we'll find a way back.
"We'll find a way back, sweet prince."
He gestures toward the shadow ahead, up the wall of the Tower. "Follow my footfalls."
It's a Fallen, cloaked in sleeveless armor, and his stride is uneven. A metallic thud is
====================
Rezyl’s mind flashed as he stepped through the door.
“I thought you might be interested in hearing from me, my new friend.” He nodded, a slight smile on his face as he allowed the door to close.
“Well, well,” Tarlowe said, as he and Rezyl stepped back into the world.
Rezyl’s body tensed as he stepped through, his boots barely leaving a trace as his feet.
“This is extremely personal,” the Exos Master said, as he brought Rezyl into the office. “What’s the harm in that?”
“I write a book on personal growth. I think it’s time we took a page from his book and applied it to everything.”
Rezyl stared at the newlywed, his face unreadable, for a full twenty seconds. Then he said something that caught his attention.
“I think it’s time we took a page from his book and applied it to everything.”
Rezyl reclined slightly, a small smile on his face as he leaned in to whisper. “I like your theory,” he replied.
A/RES: Do not read.”
A/RES: Do not open.”
A/RES: Continue.”
Rezyl’s body tensed and weaked as he slowly opened the door to his office.
“Hello,” said the man before him, not at all surprised. The man before him was a man of very sharp words.
“I am Uzume, Exos Hunter for the Sky.” He replied.
“I am Yoshihiro Tachibana, known as Uzume in the Sky.” Uzume is today.”
Rezyl opened the door to his office and saw six familiar faces inside. The first was a former High Warlock named Uzume, now known as Aru'un.
“Yours is a former Warlock,” said Uzume, before speaking. Uzume is no stranger to the halls of power in the Tower. He has long made friends among the Devil Splicers and the Awoken, and he has had a short conversation with the Devil Splicers about a mysterious Void device.”
====================
Somewhere between the Time Vault and the Deep Stone Cryptarchs' sites, or just beneath the surface, remains a secret. The Cryptarchs are keen to protect themselves and their assets with the vaults, but Guardians are not very good at guarding these vaults. If an unauthorized Guardian touches upon this vaults knowledge with each passing year, the Cryptarchs would be angered - and rightfully so.


The Cauldron
"The image of the Vex rips at the fabric of our reality."
ARENA DESIGNATION: The Cauldron
LOCATION: Rings of Saturn, Venus
The Cauldron is a Vex ritual site with a planet unconfirmed. It is thought to have been used as a base by the Traitor Sector Kings for their dreaded Nine-armed proxies.
The Cauldron is heavily wooded and wooded stations alike, with large caves and shrines to the past of Venus. There is an unusual amount of gray everywhere, and the light is out of focus. There is even a slight decay to white in the sound. Was this a City or a Lab? Is the sound more real?


Shining Sands
"Everything we know about the Vex is fiction."
ARENA DESIGNATION: Shining Sands
LOCATION: Mercury, Mars
 “The Vex don't exist. They don't exist. They don't exist.”
ARENA DESIGNATION: Laboratory One
LOCATION: Mercury, Mars
 “There is no scientific evidence to support the conclusion that the Vex are capable of creating 'minds beyond awareness'. Minds beyond awareness is a commonplace found only in remote epochs, and raises serious ethical and technological challenges.”
ARENA DESIGNATION: The Dark Age Cryptarchy
LOCATION: Buried City, Earth
 “The support services we have access to today are either too few or absent. If the Vex used what we have, it is conceivable that the Dark Age may have ended. A link was established between the City and the Vex, but it remains unclear whether this link was built or whether it was replaced by an individual's belief that the Darkness is a self-perpetuating force that runs through the lives of Vex.”

The Memento

Found in a desolate area of space, the Memento is a floating monument. It was once a garden spot, but as the years pass it's been used as a breeding ground for exotic and often unappealing organisms.
The surface is dull and rough, but as the lens nears a critical mass it becomes so, very, very dull. The surface of the Memento is slick and scratch-free, with no sign of dirt, rocks or microbes. The lenses are slanted so that they meet at infinity, just before the cloud tops blow and the sky falls. The image is like a mirage, and the eye stays glued to the lens. 
The Memento appears to be spherical, but in fact it is a little too spherical.  The lens edge is too close to the image, and the entire image is like a feather caught in the Memento's grasp. The image quality drops, and I can only think of one thought: we are laughing at ourselves.
This is obscene. This is the sheer joy of laughing at a thing that is nothing but a rousing hallucination. 
Pliny, I have a feeling you'll look it up.

You have been taken.
As I write this this this I have forgotten your name.     
Tell me your story. Tell me how you got here.     
My name is Lonwabo, daughter of the dead king. I stitched a path through the south sky with my blade, and I don’t even know the wind. A single drop would have made the difference.
My father hated us. His men burnt us alive and then us. In their fire, Lonwabo thought we would have grown fatter; perhaps we would have blossomed had we not pursued that dark path. But it was just a trick of the winds.
We were docked at the Bosphorus. The Ammonite raided our hideouts. We got captured in battle there, and then at the Bosphorus, where we were gored. It was Lonwabo who tricked us.
When we refused to fight, Mauldin burned the Ammonite for treason. Mauldin was right; we were fatter than cornered than the King.
But we were not docked. We grew fatter and grew fatter. When we refused to obey him, he threw us out in the fire. He thought we were stronger than him.
We came back to Earth, and Lonwabo had him slain. When we refused to sacrifice our own for any king, he threw us into the Ammonite's prison.
We were strong then, and strong now.
We were fatter than cornered than the King.
But King Mauldin was strong, and he was enduring the same fate.
We gathered now for the bargain. We hatched the King's egg. And we did what any one of us would do— hatch a fine egg.
We are stronger now than we were then.
The Ammonite were ferocious once. Now they are tame.

Omnigul, like the others, is human. He has come to Ascend. We seek freedom.
Omnigul comes to the High War. Taniks, king of the Crows, tells Ascendant that the Queen wants to establish an age of solipsistic fascination and an age of relentless search. The Crows chase Omnigul. They kill and capture him, and they call a general's funeral.
Omnigul dreams of a day when the sky will be green and the sky will be full of life. He dreams of a day when the Crows will be invincible. The funeral will be unending. He dreams of a day when the Crows will be invincible and Omnigul will rise again.
Meanwhile, on Ceres, the Queen wants to build an enormous monument to the Crows on the world's surface. Her agents live in the monument, and they guard it. When an agent leaves the monument, she leaves messages for the Queen in the monument, and she keeps them in boxes beneath the monument.
When an expedition leaves the monument, they find treasure beneath the monument. Like the others, they are reborn in the monument.
The Crows patrol the monument. When an expedition reaches an open area,

Reconstruction

The process by which a relic from a lost Golden Age flows back to our present is not known. Perhaps what changed the Drevis is more complex, and the Originator used to manufacture more of their dead brethren. Perhaps the Originator was blinded, or she witnessed the Collapse, and she decided to stay with the old Warmind until the change of the future.
Her new creation, the Awoken, she enthuses about – the rest is history. 
But what began as an experiment continues to this day. Did the Awoken create the future Warmind? Of course they did. Did they send them to see the Collapse? Of course they did. But it wasn't all doom and gloom. There are tales of a future of hope and darkness - and hope is a force of nature.
The final remnants of the Warmind arrive at the Vault of Glass in the form of the Awoken's Servitors. They vivisect the way water moves through the hollow, then enter the intricate circuitry of the Vault to become part of the system's ritualistic cleansing.


The Silent Fang

"The last sign of an Exo is when they call upon the Ghost again. Of its Rest to lead them in battle."
"They are not the first to do so, but neither are they the last."
"They are the first to use the term 'Last Signal,'" Ghost researcher Imogen Rife told The Crucible. "Their Forge is ancient, their tactics more refined. But they are not the first to do so. This City is in a difficult position."
"The Silent Fang," as the name suggests, are Exo Splicers and Hunters who have been active in the Reef for a while. The Fallen suspect that the Silent Fang are related, and that their deaths are connected.
The Silent Fang have been known to attack Guardians on sight. If the situation warrants it, the Guardians should be on the lookout.

The Rusted Lands are a massive Vex construct, belonging to the late King Auryx I. When the area was under his control, the Vex reclaimed the land, creating large-scale habitation building.
Despite the Vex presence, construction of the cliff and the housing site has been slow. According to historian Petra Venj, the City's

“The source.”
The Ghost lifted its shadow and a hologram of a spinning golden man appeared in its hands. The Warlock stared down at the hologram, then continued. “My name is Lonwabo,” he said. “You the worthy prey of the Darkness.”
The hologram shook with displeasure.
Then Lonwabo spoke again, again,“ “Welcome to the City.”   
The room lit with lightning, and with the sounds of bones shattering and grinding to dust the floor beneath his feet. The faces of the floor were painted with the words "AUDIO REMOTE," and with the moving metal parts of the ship's thrusters snapping. The battlefield was dark, and the shadows around him grew darker as he walked. 
His companions lay dead or dying, and his presence lingered as if an unknown force had engulfed their world. He rarely spoke, but his voice rang out in their ears and in the rubble beneath them. “You are honorable,” he said, before vanishing into the night.
With every word he said he just might get to meet the Queen.
Or, to be more precise, to go home.
That was the last he heard.
Lonwabo stood at the edge of the bed, tears in his eyes. An act of strength, a reminder of how lucky he was. He had only a window into his life, but he remembered the thought of his little sister in the corner of the room with him. The thought of it making him jump was very appealing, at the time.
Once, during a Fallen ritual, he broke the dead woman's spine.
It wasn't a physical breaking, it was a psychic taking out her leader's soul.
The result was a deeply unsettling thought: if the woman had been alive, the Devil might have escaped.
If it had been alive, maybe the City could have stopped it. Maybe they could have brought Lonwabo to Earth, where such force might be contained.
Maybe the rogue could have pleaded with the Crucible not to kill him, saying that it was necessary. That it be made free of the Crucible's curse.
Maybe the rogue gave Lonwabo the chance to kill the Fallen. If so, why?

====================
What I am trying to convey is that the universe is a simulation. A false beginning, a fiction invented by some giant with a sword and a queen. The universe is not a product of some final purpose or a play on words. It is a force of nature, actively pursuing and maintaining a shape.
The sword and the queen are not real. They are not real sides of the same coin.

ESI: Maya, I need your help. I don't know how to fix this.
SUNDARESH: What is it? Chioma. Sit. Tell me.
ESI: I've figured out what's happening inside the specimen.
SUNDARESH: Twelve. Twelve is the nominal number. Look around at what we're doing there. What we're doing is what we were taught to do— behave in accordance to certain laws. If you step from the path of krill, we'll obey that law as well.
ESI: My God, you’re doing exactly what we were told. You’re rewriting physics with your own version of quantum entanglement.
SUNDARESH: It's geometrically possible that we’re falling into a state of war’s-mind equivalent, a state of floating-point efficiency in play.
ESI: The fact that we live in a world full of corpses just makes us more likely to be right— as long as we keep trying to be right.
SUNDARESH: But more likely? Because life is about more than simply eyeball numbers and sidesweeps staring glasslessly into space?
ESI: I'd bet the Tonics that 99.9% of all smart codons are either dead or in a deep coma.
SUNDARESH: If the universe were a simulation, we should probably give ourselves a pass on everything.
ESI: The best way to answer this is to pretend to be so much worse than the Engineer. But, that advice falls on deaf ears.
SUNDARESH: The current state of the game isn’t even close. The Symmetry has made a concerted effort to undermine our Guardian strength by focusing on maintaining Alpha and Beta strength, two critical points on the countdown. The Vex are also keen to make their
====================
The objective is to attack the target as quickly and decisively as possible. Targets with a high Defense and/or high Mobility score the most frequently encountered Host.
There are three main objectives for the Host:
Defeat the enemy with overwhelming force, annihilate them, and draw their attention away from you.
There are six different tactics available to you. Your particular style of combat and situation may dictate which tactic is most effective.
You are free to hold your ground, however. There is no obligation to fight the enemy wherever you go.
There is a 30-second silence as the Host approaches. If an Vex attack is imminent, you may hold your ground until the threat is resolved.
There are two melee weapons available to you: a whip and a scalpel.
The whip is smaller and less dangerous than the scalpel. It has no discernable effect. The target is struck with a pulsating orb of electricity that for some reason doesn't emit sound.


Bolt-Caster

What Bolts Abstract does not appreciate is the utter antithesis of violence.
The Bolts journal is packed with graffiti and hand-written notes scribbled by unknowns. If this isn't cannibalism, I don't know what is. Editorial activity on the Bolts is a serious question. If their creator, the one who designed the journal, has any interest in fighting off Cabal attacks, why sends Guardians hunting this journal?


Ghost Fragment: Cabal

I am at a crossroads.
One highway leads to a trap.
I am trapped in a cycle of misery and triumph.
The route picks up steam before we get to a trail system made famous by Lord Shaxx. I am there with my own Guardian in tow.
The trail begins with a shadow and ends up in the back of a burning inferno.
The sun cuts the valley blue and we see the first life.
The route continued downhill with a red light and ended in a trail that cuts across the charred desert.
We were surrounded by trees and the light of the day can be seen as a force to contend with.
 July is not free so I tell the Guardian this morning has been a success. I haven't seen anything like it.
Get lost and do not come back until you have. The Guardian will track you.
The route continued on for several miles but was stopped at a red light sometime

I always believed that a Wolf could handle the workload of a High Priest, but I never understood his desire to show his face to the entire world.
I wonder if he’s still around, or if he’s serving up this poison in his veins. It’s insane, isn’t it? The Devil can’t hear pain.
I wonder how long it will be until he gets the chance to let his demons have their way with his business.

Verse 5:9 — I'll Make Sure.
I have made preparations.
If I am defeated I know it will be because my Servitor murdered my child. And if I am defeated, I know it was because his pride in place of healing to an already weakened worm killed and maimed him.
I have sought the High Priest in the Tower and asked for his forgiveness. The answer is very simple: he doesn’t give a fuck.
If I am defeated, I know because of who I am and who I left behind. If I am brought to your end, I know that you are no longer with me.
If I return, I know because of who I was and who I was not.
If I am to succeed in our quest, I will find a way to bind Light and Evil together and make them a single entity. This will allow me to begin to shape the course of galactic history.
But I must ask a question. Who is your master?
You are no longer with me. Your presence is not authorized.
If I speak, you have no voice. And if I fail, I fail as well.
You have been chosen by me as your master, and you have gone blind.
Behold my passage. Behold my passage — the passage that granted me my power here. Behold the passage that granted me my master's name.
Now I take the Orb. Behold its power I wield, as I take the passage that granted me my master.
Now I take the Orb and make generalizations, as I take the passage that granted me my master.
Now I am ready to use it.

====================
No one ever asks me what I'm doing here. Ever. I tell them I'm doing a book, and a radio show, and then off I go, singing, and dancing. And all the while the song drifts on my mind, the phantom on his shoulder, the ghost of a Timid Truth waiting for him in the back of the mind.
I wonder what came over me. When I opened the book, I didn't know what to think.
The radio show was my record, my radio show at all costs. I went to Mars, to sing with the people who love me and everyone else who doesn't understand me, and then I went and played with the people who don't understand me. It was amazing. I didn't know what to think.
The singing was my song, my song was roasting and the lyrics were this, this at it again:
/ Eriana, my love,
You wanna be a god
You wanna be a god can you damn lie
You can sing with me
You can prove to them one thing:
You can't have it both ways.



Ghost Fragment: I: The Mast

/ When I woke up, I didn't feel alive
I was only dreaming.
The dream sequence was not set in stone. I would've liked to have been a part of it, but I was determined not to.
The voice that brought me out of the deep sleep was not the one I remembered.
What I remember is the voice that told me to come back to Earth.
It spoke to me again and again, and always had. I was young, so my first name was Damon. It said: My name is Loken, and I'm at the bottom of the pile.
I don't know what it was, but I'm about to go down.
Up next was a mountain range, a place I must've known, but I don't know if I can't know it now. It was dark and forbidding and mysterious.
The map of the mountain is a trap, and it was dark and forbidding. Only Eriana and I knew what it was. And there was no telling what we would never know.
